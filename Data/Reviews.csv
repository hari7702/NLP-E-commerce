Very easy to use, set up and adjust resistance. Solid but portable. Primarily for chest, front delts and upper arms. Can be modified for biceps. It‚??s possible to do some behind the back stuff but that‚??s pretty awkward. It‚??s Exactly what I was looking for. Shoulder injuries limit traditional exercises like pushups for me so I am very happy to find this device to strengthen this area. I warm up on the 6-8 setting and progress to 10-12. There is a lot more potential resistance as I improve.I prefer this device to the much bigger and more expensive Bullworker for chest and shoulders exercise.

I like the idea that the screws are easy to get to and tighten if the arms get loose. The other device I purchased which is supposed to be a newer version has a cover over everything. I can't get it off since the screws holding it on won't loosen without stripping. So I just went ahead and bought this one. It feels very sturdy. I just used it for the first time. It is much more practical than the newer version. I'm getting in a good workout while I'm able to precisely set my resistance level in order to keep track of my progress. I'm wondering though how I can already be at notch 18 which is supposed to be equivalent to 400 Lbs. Maybe I'm stronger than what I thought. I am not massively huge. Oh well, anyway It's giving me an awesome workout. While people notice I'm building, I'm trying to keep it discreet how I'm doing It. Let'em think I'm going to the gym lol. I just don't know what I'm going to do once after I reach level 20(440Lbs). At least all the other exercises such as for back and biceps, and shoulders I don't need quite the max resistance, so I don't think that I'm going to outgrow the device anytime soon. As for how long the device will hold up, I'm not really worried about it. Probably at least 3 months. It's not really that expensive, so I figure I'll just buy a new one since the workout it gives me is all well worth it. Time will tell how long this one holds up. Think of all the hassle you would otherwise go through going to the gym and the money spent daily. This device is worth it even if you had to buy a new one every once in a while. Think about it lol!

I have only had this one day, but do like the feel of this piece of equipment. I feel that I can make upper body and core gains by using this is addition to other exercises. I am going to try and be creative and use this for thighs as well.

I actually enjoy using this for several sets every day in between working out with weights and resistance bands.  There are several ways to hold this and knock off sets.  As you progress with your strength you can adjust the dial for more resistance.  I always like to be able to feel a little burn in the muscles while using it... if I'm not feeling it then I dial it up a notch.  With it's small size I keep it along the side of the sofa and can knock out a few sets while my wife and I are watching a movie.  I've seen a few reviews saying that some people had some of the bolts loosen up or the cylinder start leaking fluid... mine has definitely not had either of those problems and I use it minimum of 4 to 6 sets a day. It's convenient, well made and a really good price to start working on your upper body muscle groups... watch a few videos and you will see the many different ways to use this. I highly recommend this no matter your skill level.

This works great,  I bought one for myself and one for my sister and my sister‚??s only use hers a few times and when she got it out yesterday, it‚??s leaking a lot if  oil from the shaft.Update: the seller contacted me about the above issue  and they will be replacing the product.

I thought one of the main functions of this was for bicep curls-which this is 100% useless for. It will only work your forearms not your biceps. It can be used for chest flys & if you face it backwards you can press it to the ground with 1 hand & get a decent tricep press but that's really about it. Very limited uses for this.

I can't beleive people would be out looking for this. But when you see it you notice simple things. It's adjustable and sturdy. It has a sharp and unique appearance. You can take it on the go with ease.. It does make some noise but not loud enough to bother anyone.. The grip and feel is comfortable.

This is great for a chest workout when you can't make it to the gym.  I'm an avid lifter, and I still feel like this goes up to a high-enough resistance for me to get a great workout.  The only thing is that it touts that you can also use it for arms or other exercises, and I've yet to figure out any way to actually do that.  But for just chest, it's great.

After having Covid 3 times, my lungs have a hard time while I‚??m working out. I was hoping this would really improve the strength of my lungs. I‚??m not asking for a miracle , just improvement. It has helped my habit of proper breathing to develop but it makes my mouth so tired that I dread doing it. The inside of my cheeks and lips just get so tired and the drool drips. Whether or not it would actually improve my lungs I can‚??t really say but lean toward - probably to at least some extent.
"
21,"
So, for what this is designed for, it works very well. You just pop it into your mouth as it shows in the product pictures and focus on breathing through your mouth rather than your nose. The air flow control is somewhat limited, but still offers a good enough range for progression. I don't have any issues with this version of the product, but I will warn you, if you're not used to it, you may end up over salivating while using it so when taking it out, have a napkin or something handy, and remember to wash between uses.
"

Used these during and they definitely help with breathing training. Would recommend for more outdoor type sports and training due to the fact if you drool, it will drop out of it. Kind of gross but it works lol the strength and difficulty is adjustable. Would recommend
"

It fits good, it does a good job... BUT...You end up breathing in quite cold air, it dries your mouth fast, but it creates extra saliva thats starts dripping on the sides.Not sure how this can benefit anyone. Sounds like good idea, but it's a little gadget that might serve you better than it serves me

My kids have been walking around like zombies blowing into these things in hopes that it will improve their soccer stamina. All I see is two dinosaurs with drool coming out of the sides of their mouth. I'm not sure how much longer I'll be keeping these around- they don't report feeling any differently after a week of use.

I both hate and love these things. I train often, and most times it's with a hypoxic mask -- you know, the elevation masks? I got used to that feeling after years of using them, so I decided to try these since they're supposed to do the same thing roughly.When I tell you these work, I mean it. Do NOT try to be a hero and adjust this to it's hardest setting and have an intense workout. You will literally feel it in your lungs. I'm telling you, I legitimately felt my lungs be sore from working with this. Take it slow.All I can really say without getting all scientific is that these work exactly as they're supposed to. And they work well.

First, the packaging is mediocre at best. The unit comes in 7 pieces, each in a thin bubble-wrap sleeve and all set inside a box. Second, I really cannot tell if all of the pieces I received are new, or re-packaged, or if they just appear pre-owned because they were shipped from China in less-than-ideal conditions. Anyway, they were not pristine looking, nor were they obviously used. The headrest looked brand new, so I went ahead and assembled it.Assembly is very easy. The pieces only fit a certain way. It took 10, maybe 15 minutes tops. Once assembled the unit seems sturdy. I gave it a try and did not feel any wobbling and everything stayed together.Using it is very easy. I am short and I agree with other reviews that it is quite a stretch to get to that top bar. I found myself holding on to the sides, lower down on the pads. You have to adjust your sit up to get a good crunch, but after a few tries I figured it out and definitely felt it in my abs. Also, the crunch is a very small, controlled movement which is great. You have to remember to let the unit guide the movement and not try to force a full-on sit up or you will be disappointed.I had to shave off half a star for the head rest because it really could be more comfortable without costing more. It just needs a better design. The other half-star reduction is for the packaging and look of the individual parts; there really should not be a question of everything being new.For $22 I think it is a really good buy. It provides good form for the crunch, supports my head and does not strain my neck and really allows me to isolate the ab muscles. If it lasts a full year of regular use I would happily pay $22 again next year for a new one.

The one side is almost 1/2‚?ù twisted higher than the left side.Assembly instructions a waste of time. How about stamping a letter or number on each part and showing on the instructions what fits what.One, of the two, longer hex bolt heads did not fit the enclosed hex key.The photo shows how most of the black foam is malformed.Look at reproducing the original (purple) ab roller.

I LOVE this bench it does almost everything I need it to do. I've had no problems with it and it was pretty easy to put together. It's very compact when you put it away and doesn't take a lot of space at all.BUT the leg extension leaves me a little worried. It works very well but the hinge on the leg extension has two grey plastic rings to help hold it in place and so the metal won't scrape together but it seems to be wearing down Everytime I use it. Also the padding on the feet area are a bit uncomfortable. I have to keep adjusting or i'd feel like I get blisters.The clip on the leg extensions hold the weights on there pretty good. Overall the machine holds up pretty well does what it needs to do and is pretty sturdy For the price I paid for it.... I'd say it's worth it.

I live. Full time in an RV and wanted a compact bench for a put away home gym. This bench is the center piece of that gym now.

It would be perfect if the seat moved forward and backward but that would mean it would cost $500 plus!  My legs are too short at the thigh to reach my foot under the lift. I hate straddling the front of the seat just to reach my feet forward. This is really made for guys with those long legs or some really tall woman. That‚??s the only drawback. Oh yeah! If you find some small broken piece of plastic sin the package, it‚??s probably from the seat adjustment bar. Mine was cracked but the ball pulls out fine without it. It just makes it a little difficult not to break a mail pulling on it to get it moving to adjust the seat. Also I would add some was on the seat adjuster bar too. Run a candle cause I guess until you‚??ve used it enough to loosen it up, it‚??s kind of difficult like I said to move it.Otherwise, for the money, it‚??s built sturdy and is easy to assemble and I like that it‚??s not so heavy that I can‚??t move it when I need to. The rubber door helps a whole bunch so that it doesn‚??t move when exercising. It can hold some weight too cause I‚??m not a MISS sized woman. FULL BODIED works great with this thing too. ??ç

I absolutely love this bench. It arrived today and I was able to set it up in enough time for my virtual session with my trainer. The set up was very easy. However there is a section of the bench that I‚??m unable to fit the bolt in. Thankfully it‚??s a section that isn‚??t in dire need of the bolt and will allow the bench to function as it should without it. I‚??m a 5ft girl so doing leg extensions and leg curls was difficult for me. As I you around with my workouts I‚??m sure I‚??ll be able to figure it out so I can do leg curls and extensions with ease. All in all, very happy with my decision to purchase. There won‚??t be any regrets what‚??s so ever.

Although the product arrived as expected, and it was good for the price, and easy to assemble, we were very saddened one of the feature did not work well. I didn‚??t expect my 14 year old to get hurt. The quality of the pulley system was not as expected. He was using the pull resistant feature and it ripped off and popped him in the arm and injured him. So the feature can no longer be used. But the reaming ins still excellent. The company and seller read her out later after my review and offered me a full refund for the issue. I appreciated the professional response.

I‚??m a physical therapist and my son just wanted a simple exercise bench to use at home for overall strengthing but I bought him this instead. Great product and good price.  I chose this so he can also work on his legs especially his quads. I bought the weights separately, but this bench comes with 2 removable resistance bands and adjustable back rest. And it‚??s sturdy.

This weight bench is one of those items you get, realize the quality could be better, but decide to live with anyway because it's too bulky to return. That was fine, of course, until it outright broke and I ended up falling on my butt!First, let's talk about using the bench. It's functional for basic exercises like dumbbell bench presses. You can adjust the backrest angle for more support during exercises like dumbbell curls, and it'll work‚??just fine.However, the bench doesn't lay flat, parallel to the floor. Instead, it has a slight decline that can't be corrected by adjusting the backrest. You just have to accept that it's always going to be a little off, which is frustrating but manageable.Then there are the attachments: the leg press and preacher bench. The preacher attachment is practically useless‚??it's too narrow to use with a preacher curl/EZ curl bar. As for the leg press, it's actually painful. The shin pads offer little padding, making it uncomfortable. ""No pain, no gain""? This is the wrong kind of pain.Now, for the incident that really sealed the deal: this morning, during my last set of leg presses, the bench collapsed under me. The leg press weights slid forward, and the bench slid back, sending me to the floor. Luckily, I got my legs out quickly enough.After this experience, I came back to Amazon, hoping to get some money back for this sad excuse for an exercise bench, only to find that no options are available. So, I'm writing this review to warn others. Save yourself the hassle and avoid this bench.

If your using this as a bench it's great it's held up both me 220 and my husband 300 for over a year of frequent use. However the leg piece was remove immediately due to how flimsy it is. If your adding light weight it's fine but anything over maybe 25 lbs I wouldn't. Since we can't use it to our full potential it was removed. Later the curl pad was removed as well because it's simply smaller than comfortable use demands. The bench itself pairs great with a smith machine or brench press bar.

It just makes it a little difficult not to break a mail pulling on it to get it moving to adjust the seat. Also I would add some was on the seat adjuster bar too. Run a candle cause I guess until you‚??ve used it enough to loosen it up, it‚??s kind of difficult like I said to move it.Otherwise, for the money, it‚??s built sturdy and is easy to assemble and I like that it‚??s not so heavy that I can‚??t move it when I need to. The rubber door helps a whole bunch so that it doesn‚??t move when exercising. It can hold some weight too cause I‚??m not a MISS sized woman. FULL BODIED works great with this thing too. ??ç

I absolutely love this bench. It arrived today and I was able to set it up in enough time for my virtual session with my trainer. The set up was very easy. However there is a section of the bench that I‚??m unable to fit the bolt in. Thankfully it‚??s a section that isn‚??t in dire need of the bolt and will allow the bench to function as it should without it. I‚??m a 5ft girl so doing leg extensions and leg curls was difficult for me. As I you around with my workouts I‚??m sure I‚??ll be able to figure it out so I can do leg curls and extensions with ease. All in all, very happy with my decision to purchase. There won‚??t be any regrets what‚??s so ever.

Although the product arrived as expected, and it was good for the price, and easy to assemble, we were very saddened one of the feature did not work well. I didn‚??t expect my 14 year old to get hurt. The quality of the pulley system was not as expected. He was using the pull resistant feature and it ripped off and popped him in the arm and injured him. So the feature can no longer be used. But the reaming ins still excellent. The company and seller read her out later after my review and offered me a full refund for the issue. I appreciated the professional response.

I‚??m a physical therapist and my son just wanted a simple exercise bench to use at home for overall strengthing but I bought him this instead. Great product and good price.  I chose this so he can also work on his legs especially his quads. I bought the weights separately, but this bench comes with 2 removable resistance bands and adjustable back rest. And it‚??s sturdy.

This weight bench is one of those items you get, realize the quality could be better, but decide to live with anyway because it's too bulky to return. That was fine, of course, until it outright broke and I ended up falling on my butt!First, let's talk about using the bench. It's functional for basic exercises like dumbbell bench presses. You can adjust the backrest angle for more support during exercises like dumbbell curls, and it'll work‚??just fine.However, the bench doesn't lay flat, parallel to the floor. Instead, it has a slight decline that can't be corrected by adjusting the backrest. You just have to accept that it's always going to be a little off, which is frustrating but manageable.Then there are the attachments: the leg press and preacher bench. The preacher attachment is practically useless‚??it's too narrow to use with a preacher curl/EZ curl bar. As for the leg press, it's actually painful. The shin pads offer little padding, making it uncomfortable. ""No pain, no gain""? This is the wrong kind of pain.Now, for the incident that really sealed the deal: this morning, during my last set of leg presses, the bench collapsed under me. The leg press weights slid forward, and the bench slid back, sending me to the floor. Luckily, I got my legs out quickly enough.After this experience, I came back to Amazon, hoping to get some money back for this sad excuse for an exercise bench, only to find that no options are available. So, I'm writing this review to warn others. Save yourself the hassle and avoid this bench.

If your using this as a bench it's great it's held up both me 220 and my husband 300 for over a year of frequent use. However the leg piece was remove immediately due to how flimsy it is. If your adding light weight it's fine but anything over maybe 25 lbs I wouldn't. Since we can't use it to our full potential it was removed. Later the curl pad was removed as well because it's simply smaller than comfortable use demands. The bench itself pairs great with a smith machine or brench press bar.

Ever since I have began doing yoga, I have desired  above all, the ability to do a handstand.  This eluded me for years.  I read about this product in a book, and thought I had to try one.It is incredible.  Easy to assemble and very solid.  The first time I tried it, I was able to do the elusive handstand!  I was concerned about stability, but that turned out to be for nothing.  The unit is very stable and secure feeling.  And I am 6'02"" and 225 lbs, have a bad back, two metal knees, and zero natural balance.

I previously bought and returned two cheaper benches which had missing parts, were scuffed and dinged from manufacture and didn't fit together at all. This Feetup bench is recommended by yoga journal for a reason; it is well manufactured (in Europe, apparently) and is way higher quality.The pieces are all perfectly machine-cut and the bolts are better quality than the cheaper versions, which are soft metal that was in danger of getting chewed up by the Allen wrench (so possibly weaker!!!) The Feetup bench also has rubber feet screwed into the bottom of the legs, the cheaper versions I purchased had stick-on felt pads or nothing at all. The Feetup bench is not going to slide!The Feetup bench comes with lots of literature, a big poster and a neat little cardboard phone/tablet stand that hooks onto the crossbeam so you can follow a yoga class on your phone. Not a deal breaker, but all the literature and nice packaging confirms that this is a high quality item, not just a jumble of parts dumped in a box in China, as my previous purchases most definitely were!Relieved to finally have the right yoga inversion bench.

I love this inversion table so much I bought one for my office.  I find that it makes my neck and back feel great after sitting long hours. I like to do crunches on it upside down, but I haven't tried the full range of exercises listed on the poster. I just use it for relaxation and enjoyment and to reduce fatigue from sitting. I cannot believe how sturdy it is. I can fall over backwards (sort of into a back bend) and it still doesn't tip or move from the ground. I highly recommend. Though it seems a little overpriced at $200, for the simple materials its made from, it is excellent quality.

Best purchase I‚??ve made in years!  Pretty pale pink band with gold accents is true to what it looked like on Amazon.  Very pretty and soft silicone band.  Also in the package is the manufacturer‚??s email and if you email them they will send you two additional watch bands of your choice.  They have three different texture options in many colors to choose from.  When you email them, you qualify for their lifetime warranty and if you have any issues, you would work directly with them through the email.  I am very impressed with them for such a cheap/affordable product only $39, they really stand behind it.  This watch is amazing, it is very easy to use & it has many face display options. Simply hold down on the face with your finger and it will bring up all the options.  Scroll left and right then you select the one you want by touching it.  So easy to change the face.  I have included some pictures showing you some of the face options.  I hate using things that are complicated and this is so easy. I absolutely love it! It comes with very easy to follow instructions, and it tells you how to download their app.  I installed the ‚??Da Fit‚?ù app on my iphone and I can go on my phone to check my blood pressure or heart rate, or I can simply swipe to the left on the watch to find the option I want and touch it to take my blood pressure, oxygen levels or heart rate directly from my watch. It also gives me notifications if I get a text message or phone call or if I have an alarm set, my watch will vibrate.  There are also three alarms that you can set from their app. That is really nice because I now use the app alarms to remind me when to take my medication. So now I have three daily alarms on the app and four daily alarms I can set on my iPhone, which gives me a total of seven alarms per day to remind me to get up in the morning for work, clock into work, clock out of work, alarm to remind me when my lunch break is over, and when to take medication.  I really like that it tracks my steps too because we are recording these for my employer. I went into the ‚??Da Fit‚?ù app under settings and have linked it to Strava directly through the watch app which was super easy.  Strava communicates with my employer, so it records all of my steps from this watch automatically without me doing a thing.  We are doing a fitness challenge at work, so this makes it really easy to participate. My favorite thing is how easy it is to use. All you do is swipe left to see all of the different options like blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen levels, steps, fitness, and even sleep quality.  You can sleep wearing the watch but overtime it might make your wrist sore so I try to only sleep with the watch on every other night instead of every night.  I find it very interesting that I only have quality sleep for under two hours per night because I move around a lot while I‚??m sleeping which prevents me from getting a quality rest, which explains to me why I‚??m tired every day. This watch has really given me insight to my health issues.  Compared to all of the other fitness watches out there that cost hundreds and do the same thing, this one is a wonderful deal, beautiful and very affordable!  I actually own an Iwatch but I prefer this one because it‚??s easier to use.  I highly recommend this product to everyone I know!

I've had mine for about a month now and unlike the last smart watch I purchased, I'm still wearing it.It's smaller than most smart watches and doesn't look obnoxious.  It has what I would consider a very clean appearance.What it does vs. what I expected it to do:  It doesn't do 'continuous' heart rate monitoring.  The shortest interval you can set in the app is five minutes, so if you're looking for something that can perform as a wearable ECG, you'll need to look elsewhere.  Also, though I find the app pretty good overall for a Chinese electronics device, there is no way as far as I can determine to export any of the health data.  You just have pretty graphs or charts to look at inside the app.Since everything above seems more on the negative than positive side I'll go ahead with the device's other caveat--I do not have any faith in the accuracy of the blood oxygen sensor.  It always returns 97-99 for me (usually 98-99).  My finger meter is usually 94-95.That being said, I do believe the heart rate sensor and the blood pressure sensor are both pretty accurate.  My blood pressure generally runs from baseline normal (120/80) to upper end of normal (140/90) and this device consistently reports as such and rises and dips based on how much stress I'm putting on myself.Oh, also the pedometer is probably as accurate as virtually any other wearable device you can get.  I've counted off and checked against it a few times and it's accuracy is always in the upper 90 percentile range.The battery life is great.  I switched it to not wake the display unless I press the button and I've charged it once (a few days ago) in the past three weeks, and that is with the five minute heart rate monitor option.Overall five stars for the value of this device.  Great looks, great battery life, mostly good sensor performance, and an easy enough app to use though I hope they continue improving it and give us an option to export data in the future.

I was looking for a watch that would measure my blood pressure, related to some concern for health issues that run in my family. I wanted to be able to take it as needed at my convenience. I read the reviews prior to making my purchase, and the endless scroll of 5 stars was enough to me. I was also excited to see that there were other features that I was looking for, like sleep tracking, bluetooth connection with your phone, heart rate monitoring, and step counting. The watch arrived overnight and in great condition. The instructions were easy to follow. It came with the charging cord that was needed, and the app that pairs with the watch is aesthetically pleasing and easy to navigate. The only downside of the app is that the numbers don‚??t seem to match up. When I was putting in my height and weight, the app added about 10 inches and 10 pounds. So to set my weight at 160, I had to set it to 150. Not a big deal whatsoever for the reason I purchased the watch, but still something to keep in mind. The watch arrived just as pictured, and the color combination is adorable. I love the pink band with the gold watch. However I personally am not a big fan of silicone watch bands. It makes me feel claustrophobic. I was thrilled as I was unboxing the watch and saw a card that provided an email address to reach out to for a warranty and 2 free watch bands in different materials. I reached out, and their customer service has been AMAZING. They even offered free wireless earbuds. This is the most satisfied I have been with a purchase in a LONG time. I love my new watch, and I love this company. Thank you!!

Seems to be fairly accurate when tested against other devices. For example the BP reading are pretty close to the cuff device I have. I only gave 4 stars because of the charging. Unlike most watches I've had it does not alert you when it HAS to be charged and then it takes at least 2 hours - more if you want it at 100%. And you cannot look at the app to see how far along the charging is unless you disconnect the watch from the charger first.Maybe I got spoiled with my amazfit watch it lasted 6 or 7 days, warned me when it needed charged and fully charged in about 40 minits. I switched because I wanted the BP feature and regularly timed heart rate readings. Overall I feel I got my moneys worth but taking it off for over 2 hours to charge kinda sux especially every 3rd day.

I'm 49, this is the first smartwatch i've ever owned. I specifically bought this watch to monitor my blood pressure and other vitals. The watch is performing great. It was easy to set-up, easy to link to my Iphone. You can actually customize the watch and all the settings after downloading the app, all the changes take effect on the watch. Screen display is great, touch screen great, multiple formats to choose from. Watch feels solidly built with a very comfortable soft touch band. For what I paid, options this watch offers compared to other smart watches on the market this is a no brainer. I'd recommend this watch to friends and family. My wife and 17 year old daughter want one now and they're Apple fanatics. Someone commented that this watch doesn't keep track of your hear rate all day, it does in fact, you have to adjust the frequency under setting on the app on phone. I have mine set to check every 2 minutes all day and the HR is in fact displayed. Also, make sure you have the right face selected that shows heart rate. Accuracy of the blood pressure is in line with my home monitor, so it does work. It records all readings in a chart on the phone app, this is helpful for doctor visits.

I wouldn't even think of depending on the readings for blood pressure or oxygen. I originally thought that the sleep tracking was just stopping randomly in the middle of the night, but I discovered that the glitch was in the app and the watch was operating properly. Tapping the watch and then using the app again yields the correct sleep tack. Still, it is handy for steps, weather, generally ok for sleep tracking, and alarms, plus it's cute and cheap. I haven't tried the camera or phone/text notifications.

When a different name brand fitness tracker stopped displaying my info after only 4 months of use, I decided to try this one. I have been very happy that I did. It appears to be fairly accurate with its HR, BP (which I have double checked with a separate arm unit) and O2 sat. When I received a replacement for my other faulty tracker, I wore them for several days to compare and I have chosen to continue to wear this one. It is attractive and cost less than 1/3 the cost of the other tracker. The only drawback is that it must be very sensitive when I am on the lawnmower...it racks up lots more steps than I am taking then. Maybe the bumpy lawn or maybe it picks up on my arm movements, I don't know. But I would definitely choose this tracker again.

Since I‚??ve had some health problems of late, I really like being able to do my vital signs everyday.  I like that I have so many choices on the face of the watch.  Passed waterproof test as far as washing hands frequently had no effect on the watch.  The band color is pretty in pink.  I work nights and the watch couldn‚??t figure out I was asleep during the day.  So disappointed on tracking my sleep which was a big reason why I wanted the watch.

Kind of disappointed in this product. At first i got it to try because ive seen similar products being shown on youtube and thought itd be fun. When i first took it out of the box it was very loud and obnoxious, it makes the cheap action movie sounds when people get punched. *POW* *BANG* . There is no option to turn the sound effects off. even after turning on bluetooth you can hear the puching sounds over the music.The lighting ques do not synch with the music either so youre punching in different timing. After accepting that this probably isnt the product for me i thought hey maybe our toddler (almost 5) would enjoy hitting it. Unfortunately you have to hit it with the strength of an adult to hear a childs sound effect.

It's a fun idea but doesn't work quite like they advertise. You have to hit the board pretty hard, which the only problem is rolling your wrist if you don't hit it just right.

These are actually really cool machines for keeping you active. From kids to the elderly, it is a great option. It does not require too much pressure to register a punch. So, anyone can use the machine. The speed is even adjustable so you won't get bored as you advance.  The machine itself is well-made, out of foam like material, and is very easy to install. You can install it on almost any flat surface easily, with Velcro. There is also a massive double sided sticky pad on the back, if you would like to permanently attach it to your wall. They have included plenty of Velcro, so you can attempt to hang it several times.  The only reason I took a star off, is because unlike other versions of this machine, there is no battery in it. It is not rechargeable. It Has to be plugged into the wall at all times, so keep that in mind while installing.  Overall, this is still a really cool product. It does work exactly like it is supposed to, and can put up quite a bit of abuse. Soft, and safe, for anyone. Highly recommended.

Primarily i got this for stress relief and it sure works. This thing is awesome. Comes with some okay gloves. I hoped that you didnt have to have it plugged in while using it but you do. The bluetooth option is super neat and helps you get into the beat even easier then without music. Super slick and hangs easy on the wall or door. Be careful where you place it though as thin doors wouldn't be the best location.

Overall, this is a super fun boxing machine!  I was honestly pleasantly surprised by the quality.  The machine itself is nice and sturdy.  The bluetooth speaker is actually pretty decent quality as well for you to play your music through as you work out.  It also has a built in default song if you don't want to use the bluetooth speaker.  As other reviews have said, the lights don't go with your music, but I expected that.  There are several different modes of lights that you can use, and you can adjust the speed of the lights changing as well.  I thought that it would make some sort of sound or keep ""score"" as you hit the lighted pads, but it doesn't and really just lights up to give you a frame of reference of where to hit.  The adult sized MMA gloves that it comes with are really nice quality.Only taking off one star for a few reasons:- There is no option to screw it onto the wall, it just comes with velcro adhesive strips.  I feel like it would be sturdier if you could screw it onto the wall.- The USB power cord it comes with is not very long and plugs into the side of the machine instead of the bottom, so it's hard for it to reach the outlets.  It also does not come with a power brick, so you have to use your own.- The children's red boxing gloves it comes with are very small and it looks like the set I got may have been used already as there was white fuzz stuck into the velcro.Overall though, I would certainly recommend this fun product!

Keep a screw driver and crescent wrench handy if you intend on using for high reps. I do up to 2000 reps daily. Some days lower reps higher weight resistants. Building some good strength up and intending on continuing this workout until I‚??m healed from surgery.IF YOURE JUST SITTING AROUND GET THIS MACHINE IT WILL CHANGE HOW YOU FEEL AND HOW STRONG YOU ARE RAPIDLY. START ON WHATEVER LEVEL YOU CAN DO 50 REPS THEN FIND THE LEVEL YOU CAN DO SETS OF 25 and do sets till 1000. KEEP GOING IF TOU GOT IT IN YOU. TRY AND GET AS MANY AS YOU CAN OTHER WORKOUTS WILL BE EASIER. ITLL MOTIVATE YOU TO DO BETTER ON OTHER THINGS BC YOU WILL FEEL STEONGER.

In going to be straight with you. This is my third arm strength exerciser thingy just like this one. The first one had springs and though it's ok, I don't like it very much. It's noisy and the bars are too close together.The second one was like this but had the electronic counter and I loved it. But it fell apart after a month.So my approach to this will be first impression, and then a how it's going and finally an I've broken this one too update.I've had this a few weeks now and I'm really liking it. I miss the electronic counter as I personally found that very motivating. But the hand grips are very comfortable and the bars spaced far enough apart that it feels like you are getting a good bit of excersise with it.The hydraulic is nice. It feels so smooth and easy as you squeeze the handles together. Now I've read about these leaking fluids. I manage about a hundred a day with this so we will see how long it lasts.One last thing for now. The settings are very easy to adjust, and I'm happy with that. All it is with this one, a simple dial you turn. I'm on 2.5 or so because I'm a big sissy weakling but it will be interesting to see how long I will be there before moving up a bit.Will update this later.Just a brief update here. It's still going quite strong with none of this hydraulic leakage, so far. I read that in some other reviews but happy to say no issues with it.One thing I did learn is that you want to go round every now and then and tighten the bolts. Phillips screwdriver and a pair of pliers does the job. Once the bolts fall out, one so far, they are a bit of a hassle to get back in again.I've moved up to 3 on the rotating scale thingy and it's much harder to do. So down to about 60 per day as opposed to 100.I've found it's building arm, shoulder, chest and ab muscles effectively.That's all for now. Will update again later.So I got this in June and we are now in September. Time to provide an update.It's going great for me. The bolts do need tightening fairly regularly. I've not experienced this dread leakage of the hydraulic fluid. In fact it's working great so far.I'm up to a three on the rolling scale thingy. My chest has expanded with use and abs have been developing too. This does help activate core muscles and that was unexpected for me.Really glad to have this and I hope it lasts a good while yet.

It works well but the screws like to come loose and need to be retightened and the product feels cheap. The dial has a sticker for measuring the level of resistance above it and that sticker was peeling when I got it. Cheaply made but a decent product.

UPDATEIt only took one day and now it has no compression, even when dialed up to setting 12. Save your money and get a different brand.ORIGINAL REVIEWI've been using a different brand of ""Hydraulic Arm Exerciser"". Yesterday it exploded when I compressed it because the bottom part was plastic (see photo). I already like this brand better because the plastic has been replaced with metal.This item arrived in one day, and I worked out with it tonight. I started with it on setting 8 out of 12, right out of the box. I do sets of 15 reps (see video). These devices will help you bulk up and even pump up your heart rate if you're doing cardio.This was also an excellent price, assuming it will last for a year or so. I got slack about working out recently and it shows. But I'm determined to get back into shape, and this device will be a key part of it!

I‚??m looking to gradually getting to doing more exercise this year, but I wanted an alternative to my preferred methods of walking or biking that I can do indoors when I am busy until it‚??s too late to walk or in inclement weather. This works great, because it is also extremely easy to watch tv while using this product, which helps encourage me to use it on days I‚??m feeling especially lazy.It works well, the links seem sturdy when clicked together and the ball is a decent weight. It takes a second to figure out how to use it; I‚??ve seen a lot of reviews saying they have to put it on the shortest length not to hit anything, only the shorter it is the harder it is to make it spin. When the ball is out further it can use its own momentum to help it spin, which helps you get it to go faster. I have my string at the maximum length without issue; I stand in front of my tv just far away not to hit it and it isn‚??t low enough to hit the coffee table behind me. If you have rambunctious children or jumpy dogs this may be a problem and you‚??ll need to find a private place to use it safely.I‚??ve only used it two days for 30 mins each, and though I haven‚??t quite worked up a sweat I am seeing a similar calorie burn to when I go on my usual walks, which are typically about 1.5 miles and just under 30 mins. I‚??ve found that if I can get it spinning good I can sometimes even lift my feet up, and if I can keep my hips twisting at the right rhythm it‚??s almost like running in place and I did get my heart rate up a few times. (Note that I‚??m overweight but not obese; if you have serious extra weight you would probably need to work up to that level of moving). I did already remove a link after just two uses, but rather than it being a miracle product I just figured out the best way to get the ball to move, which meant wearing it a little tighter so that is wouldn‚??t fall down to my waist as easily (I wasn‚??t necessarily wearing it loose before, but when the ball is moving quickly it pulls the band away from your body a bit, so you need to wear it a little tighter than you might think).The only potential issue I see is that it seems like the wheels on the internal track may start to wear down over time, especially since I‚??ve been able to move it fast. I‚??ve only used it a couple times so this is not quite a problem yet. I‚??m hoping this won‚??t become a huge problem, but if it does I will update.I‚??m hoping that as I continue to use it I can master the rhythm better and be able to get my heart rate up for longer. It is the exact same motion as regular hula hooping, but in my opinion more fun because I don‚??t have to stop to pick it up each time it falls, I just throw the string around my body easily if I lose the pacing and it drops. I don‚??t think it by itself will help me lose weight, but I am optimistic that combining with my walking and biking it will help me get in track, and mostly keep me accountable for the lazy days I don‚??t want to go outside and would rather catch up on my shows.

The box it came in was sturdy, with a  plastic insert holding everything together. I had no problems putting it together. Using it takes some finesse, my 15-year-old son can use it much better than I can. I‚??ve seen in videos that you‚??re supposed to use it for 30 minutes a day but I‚??ll definitely have to work up to 30 minutes a day. Today on my first day it was five minutes. It is a bit noisy, but I‚??ve seen that another reviews so I expected it. It is wheels running on the inside of plastic so you cannot expect it to be silent. I was able to watch TV while using it. It was not so noisy that I could not hear the TV. Since I‚??ve only had it for one day, I don‚??t think my review is any sort of expert opinion above and beyond that it came in very good condition, in a very good box and works just fine. About the longevity and quality of the materials, only time will tell.

Who knew I‚??d be a hula-hooper in my 30s! I have struggled with my weight my entire life and this hoop is truly helping me stay active and lose weight. I wasn‚??t able to do the recommended 30 minutes at first, but I worked myself up to it and did my first 30 minutes yesterday! It feels like a full body workout! My core is engaged, and I can feel it working in my butt and legs a lot! To get my arms more involved, I hold them out to my sides, in front of me, or above my head for as long as I can while I hoop. It‚??s much more fun than a treadmill, I promise you that. I can still breathe comfortably while I workout, but I am burning a wicked sweat! My heart rate is definitely up while I hoop!I am a teacher, and it‚??s been easy to use during summer vacation. I am looking forward to seeing if I can keep up when I get back to my normal work schedule.Overall, I‚??m so glad I got it! It‚??s easy and quick to put on. I don‚??t have to leave the house to use it, and that‚??s a big plus!Many people talk about how loud the hoop is when using it, but it‚??s plastic vigorously rubbing on plastic. The sound should not be a deterrent if you are serious about losing weight. I listen to music and start hooping! The time goes by quickly and it‚??s over before you know it!Update: I am three days shy of my one month trial of the hoop, and I have seen drastic changes in my body. Today, I took off my first link, equivalent to 2 inches. The hoop has been easy to use every day and I truly enjoy using it. I cannot recommend this enough.

It does take a bit of time to remaster the art of hula hooping but it‚??s a fun way to workout! I measured my waist to ensure I got the correct fit.

I was skeptical to get this. I‚??ve read and heard countless stories that the weighted hoops that weren‚??t the band name one were not good. The wheels always got stuck or it was just poorly made and always fell apart. But I have been pleasantly surprised. It takes a few tries to get the flow going. So don‚??t get discouraged if you can‚??t get it consistently going at first. I‚??ve had mine for I think like a month. Still don‚??t have it down 100% but I get better every time I use it/ haven‚??t had any issues with the weight or the wheels. And I haven‚??t had any problems with it falling apart when I‚??m using it. I like that I can do something to get my heart pumping a bit. I‚??m trying to get back in shape but have quite of few of health issues and physical issues that make it hard to do just any working out. This is perfect. I‚??m glad I gave this a shot.

I bought this after a friend let me try hers. It seemed like a good workout with less twisting than a traditional hula hoop, which is great for me since I have had herniated disc issues. I'm not quite up to 30 minutes a day yet, but have gotten to 20. I've had it for about 3 weeks now, and still haven't used it consistently enough to see any results,  but it is a fun workout. I usually do it while watching TV. There is a noise factor to consider, I have to increase the volume on the TV to be able to hear it while using it, but it's not a problem. So far, I like it a lot, just need to develop a habit of daily use to see results. I just shared the link with a friend, who is interested in buying one. It's well made, simple to assemble and use. I recommend suspecting the links in like you think ot should go rather than trying to follow the instructions, they can be a bitconfusing. If you look at the links that are already connected you can pretty much figure out how to add  or separate the links.

The only reason that I gave this 4 stars is because it make A LOT of noise.  The track is not smooth and gets caught up easily.

The Daphne Ab and Arm Belt is an interesting piece of equipment. It looks sleek and futuristic, which is pretty cool, but getting it to work was a bit of a challenge. The instructions could be clearer; it took me a while to figure out how to turn it on.Once it's up and running, the belt gives you quite a workout. It feels like a firm, pulsating hug, which can be a bit intense but definitely makes you feel like you're doing something. I wore it to work, and while it was a bit distracting, I could feel it working on my abs and arms.One thing to note is the intensity levels. Level 1 is manageable and gives a gentle pulse, but level 5 is a whole different beast. It really ramps up the intensity and, to be honest, it hurts! It's like being pinched repeatedly by a very determined crab. So, if you're brave enough to go to the higher levels, be prepared for a serious challenge.Overall, if you're looking for a unique way to tone your muscles, the Daphne Ab and Arm Belt might be worth a try. Just be prepared for a bit of a learning curve and a lot of buzzing!

This device is a game-changer when it comes to toning and strengthening my abdominal muscles. The belt ia EMS effective and provides a comfortable and targeted muscle stimulation experience.I have been using it for a few weeks now and have already noticed a significant improvement in the tone and definition of my abs. The different intensity levels allow me to customize my workout to fit my fitness level and goals.

It's a quality product that delivers results in a convenient and efficient manner.I hope you find this review helpful!

I have atrophied muscles due to Arnold Chiari Malformation of the Brain. Any exercise that involves tensing up my neck muscles is very hard for me to do, it sets off extreme pain in my neck and head. I got this to try and begin to work my abs and arms and legs. For the price, I was not expecting a whole lot to be honest, but this WORKS. It will take a long time to get my muscles back to where they were before but this is a beginning. The intensity goes up a LOT. I did not need to use gel or water to get this to work, which is nice. And even if this stops working after a few months of using it daily, the low price will allow me to get another one to replace the used one. I should have gotten one of these a long time ago!

The DAPHNE Ab Stimulator & Muscle Toner comes with a waist belt, and two smaller belts for the arms or legs, depending on your size. The waist belt can be used on the legs as well, again, depending on your size. They are comfortable and easy to adjust. Each belt comes with a rechargeable adjustable ems snap-on that regulates the muscle contractions. There are many modes to choose from as well as intensity levels.I started using it while working, which is sitting in a chair at a computer. It was fine but but my arms would twitch involuntarily (upper arms are more sensitive and I had it on a high level), so I now wear them while I workout on the elliptical. It's the perfect match! I'm on week two and I can definitely see a difference. Honestly, you can wear these doing pretty much anything; dishes, housework, driving, walking, working out, standing, shopping, etc. You'll forget you're wearing them while you tone your muscles!Try them today!

Efficiency: From the first session, I could feel my muscles engaging in a way that mimicked a rigorous workout. The targeted stimulation not only worked wonders on my abdomen but also on my arms and legs, providing a full-body toning experience.Convenience: What truly sets the Daphne ABS Stimulator apart is its convenience. With a busy schedule, finding time for lengthy gym sessions can be challenging. However, with this stimulator, I can easily incorporate muscle toning into my daily routine. Whether I'm working, reading, or even cooking dinner, I can effortlessly wear it, allowing me to multitask without sacrificing my fitness goals.Comfort: I was initially concerned about discomfort or irritation, but the Daphne ABS Stimulator proved to be incredibly comfortable to wear. The adjustable intensity levels allowed me to customize the experience to suit my preferences, ensuring a pleasant workout every time.Results: The results speak for themselves! With consistent use, I noticed a significant improvement in muscle definition and tone. My abdomen feels firmer, my arms more sculpted, and my legs stronger. It's truly remarkable how such a compact device can deliver such impressive results.

I really wanted this to work well for me but I don't like it very much. I feel like it engages your nerves more than your actual muscles. Like little nerves twitches. I may be using it wrong but it's pretty easy to use so I doubt that. I'll try again and hopefully get better results...

Works as intended, but be careful! The directions are sparse to say the least (pun intended). Arm bands are designed for smaller people as is the belt itself. Too small for anybody that‚??s over an XL in pants. I‚??m close, but made it work.1. Make sure to use the water spritzer. The one provided is poor at best. Buy a small hand spritzer or mister - it makes a huge difference in conduction.2. The contact pads work well and the fact you don‚??t have to use replaceable gel pads is awesome.3. The electrodes (TEMS units?) basically have no instructions. They snap on and off easily and are easy to charge.4. It‚??s trial and error for which mode and intensity works for you. The later modes mix up the sequencing better, but watch the intensity levels. They can, um, surprise you with how strong the contractions can be.After a month of nearly daily use, the system is still going strong, but I had to replace the spritzer. There is a bit of fraying around the Velcro attachment areas, but that can be remedied with a clothing fuzz remover or de-pilling shaver. Be careful how much material you remove as it can affect how well the Velcro attaches. If it gets too thin, you could use an iron-on Velcro patch to extend its life.One thing did make me laugh while using the system. On your arms, if you get really good conduction on a rapid pulse mode, you will have NO CONTROL of your lower arms! Talk about ‚??QUIT HITTING YOURSELF!‚?ù Absolute riot! Best laugh I‚??ve had in months!

I really like how the abdominal belt works. It has an adjustable Velcro attachment that will fit a variety of sizes. I can feel my muscles moving as if they are contracting. The belt has a small attachment that you can use to change the mode and apply more or less strength to it.My problem is with the arm belts. They deliver painful shocks! Even when placed on level 1 and in all modes it is just extremely painful. They are not supposed to shock you.

I like these belts.  You can feel that they‚??re doing something to your muscles.  But if you‚??re a smaller person it‚??s not going to fit you.  I have about a 27 inch waist I think, and the ab belt is way too big for the Velcro to attach.  I have to pull it tight and sit down holding the belt against my abs.  The arm ones fit better.  I can even get them over my legs for a workout there as well although it‚??s a very tight fit.

I've used the abs simulator belt for going on two months.  Do I see or feel a difference?  Yes, I totally do not just in appearance but in physical strength as well. Now I am not going to say that I dropped 5 inches and 30lbs in the first two months, but there is a physical difference. One important thing is that you have to position the abs simulator to stimulate different abdominal muscles

I recently purchased the chopper, and it has completely transformed my meal prep routine! This chopper is an absolute game-changer in the kitchen. The quality of the blades is exceptional‚??they slice through vegetables with ease, making chopping quick and effortless. I love the versatility of the different blade options, which allow me to dice, slice, and julienne a variety of veggies with perfect precision.One of the standout features is the large container that catches all the chopped produce, keeping my countertop clean and organized. The non-slip base ensures the chopper stays in place during use, providing added safety and stability. Cleaning is a breeze too, as all the parts are dishwasher safe.The build quality is top-notch, and it feels durable and well-made. This chopper has significantly reduced my prep time, and I find myself eating healthier because it's so easy to prepare fresh vegetables. I highly recommend!

I saw an item like this on Facebook and wanted to try it. It works SO WELL! It's small enough to fit in my kitchen island, because all of the blades nest inside containers that fit inside the main unit. It's easy to put together, and the spring action makes dicing vegetables super easy. I have arthritis in my hands that makes chopping vegetables difficult for me, but this will make all the difference! I love that i can wash it in the dishwasher if I need to, but so far it's been easy to clean without that, because it includes a little gadget to clean in between the blades without touching them and then you can just rinse them with soap and water. I made a salad in just a few minutes. would definitely recommend it!

I am pleasantly pleased with this product! I do alot of cooking, and have a large garden that produces a lot of vegetables. I've developed arthritis in my hands which has made it difficult to keep up. I still have to do some cutting to fit the size of the chopper but it's significantly helped reducing the time and saves my hands. Cons: I wish the chopping area was larger. I also wish it had something on the bottom to keep it from sliding. Sometimes stuff gets stuck in the grid-like top of the chopperPros: It's sharp and cuts well. I LOVE that this one is dishwasher safe- many are not! It's easy to use. So far, it seems durable enough to withstand garden season. Comes with multiple options for different sized cuts/slices.

I am very happy with this item. I'm 80 and my hands are arthritic, so its a huge help. It does not do green onions very well as they get mushed in the grids and its takes less force if you cut your items smaller to fit depending on what you are cutting. It is very sharp, nicked my self first thing, twice, but I knew better. It cuts well and cleans up with a rinse under the tap. I think you just have to experiment with chopping different veggies to see what it can do. The trick is getting used to its capabilities. I am very happy with it and its a good investment.

Love this, saw all the TikTok videos showing these devices, after researching the different models and reviews, paid a couple more dollars for the original brand, as the cheaper models didn‚??t look as good.Very sturdy and well made, cuts potatoes and other foods with ease, stores easily. In a time when so many devices/tools are getting flimsier and cheaper, the quality of this, reminded me more of how things were made 30 or more years ago when everything wasn‚??t meant to be replaced every other year. Will make soups, casseroles, salads so easy.

The Mueller Pro-Series 10-in-1, 8 Blade Vegetable Chopper is a valuable addition to any kitchen, especially for those who frequently cook with fresh vegetables. Its multi-functionality, efficiency, and ease of use make it a great investment for saving time and effort in food preparation. While blade changes might require a bit of practice, the overall convenience and performance outweigh this minor drawback.

Chops great, I make a lot of salads or bowls with chopped vegetables. The Mueller Pro is fantastic. I have a tremor and using a knife can be precarious, this is a perfect solution. I have tried similar products in the past but was frustrated with how hard they were to use. This item is easy to use, speeds up to process of chopping, and clean up is much easier than a food processor. I highly recommend.

I needed an old school egg chopper like my mama used to have. This popped up on sale, so I decided to give it a go. (Bonus points for it being a product from a small company.) Honestly, for the price, I expected it to be kinda crappy, but I was surprised when I was proved wrong. This is delightful. The first thing I had to try was the tomatoes. I got stuck for a second, but if you kind of slide the vegetables and such in a left to right motion instead of straight, they slice beautifully with no issues. And my ADHD self loves that they are perfectly thin and all the same size. The slicer is extremely easy to clean.Next, I tried the onions. This one was a bit more challenging. Slicing worked beautiful, but dicing was a little difficult. I ended up having to quarter the onions and then chop them. The dicer plate seemed like it was going to break and I was a bit scared. It wasn't a big deal. The cleaning on the dicer was awful. It took me 3 or 4 washes to get all the onion out of it. So, I probably won't use the dicer for onions again.All over, I would recommend this to anyone who slices, chops and dices a lot. It's quick, efficient, easy to adjust, and (mostly) easy to clean.

I am a pet owner that loves to buy my pups Fresh Pet (fresh refrigerated dog food) but I‚??m also a cheapskate so I buy the rolls since they‚??re way cheaper than the crumbles. That means I‚??ve got to cut it up myself & I hate that. This is a dream for that purpose. I slice the roll, stick the slices on the grate (1-2 at a time) & press! Wahlaa! The sharp blade tray is a pain to clean by hand so plan on tossing it in the dishwasher. This used to take me forever but now it just takes a few minutes. Love it!

I have a Mueller inversion blender and trusted this brand already. I ordered two of these (one for me and one for my daughter) during Prime sales. I keep seeing these types of multi chopper/slicers on Instagram food accounts I  follow. I used it already to chop and dice mushrooms, onions, squash. cucumber, bell pepper, and tomatoes. I have not used the slicing/grating tools yet. ‚??Wetter‚?ù foods like peppers, tomatoes, and cucumbers can be a little messy and not as easy to clean as ‚??harder‚?ù foods. I am a very capable cook and just wanted easier prep of basics (and a fun new gadget). I also cry a lot when preparing onions and this helped do it faster and get I to the fridge or pan before the tears begin! I can‚??t wait to use it for potatoes. It‚??s going to make a soup recipe and home fries easier to make. I probably wouldn‚??t have splurged if it wasn‚??t discounted because I have a food processor.

I recently purchased the chopper, and it has completely transformed my meal prep routine! This chopper is an absolute game-changer in the kitchen. The quality of the blades is exceptional‚??they slice through vegetables with ease, making chopping quick and effortless. I love the versatility of the different blade options, which allow me to dice, slice, and julienne a variety of veggies with perfect precision.One of the standout features is the large container that catches all the chopped produce, keeping my countertop clean and organized. The non-slip base ensures the chopper stays in place during use, providing added safety and stability. Cleaning is a breeze too, as all the parts are dishwasher safe.The build quality is top-notch, and it feels durable and well-made. This chopper has significantly reduced my prep time, and I find myself eating healthier because it's so easy to prepare fresh vegetables. I highly recommend!

This does not make a lot of popcorn. Think of it as single serving. It doesn't even fill one of the small paper popcorn bags, but that's fine. It pops quickly to make mulitple batches.You'll probably need two sets of times for this, the time for when it's just popcorn and the time for when there is butter in the top section. The butter drops as the popcorn pops, which makes it distribure evenly, which is wonderful, but which pulls away some of the heat. In my microwave, it's 2:30 just popcorn and 2:45 for popcorn with butter, to give you an idea. It's not a huge difference, but if I don't give those extra fifteen seconds, a lot of the kernals don't pop.That said, it's really consistent, and once you have your two times, you can just reuse them, no issue. Even if you do two batches back to back, the time is the same.It is critical that the turntable in the microwave actually be turning while you're using this, or the best case is the popcorn just won't pop. The instructions say it can damage that microwave. I lucked out, but ended up with a kettle of hot, unpopped kernals, save for two or three.My only complaint about this is it makes buttered popcorn so quickly, so easily, and so well I'm probably eating more of it than I should.

Pops great, only 5 kernels didn't pop.The smaller quantity the popper pops up is a good thing since my spouse doesn't eat popcorn. The melting butter in the lid was also a plus. My induction stovetop popper was not doing a good job. Our living room and kitchen are red, the assorted colors are are very attractive and you should be able to find one to blend with your decor. The design is creative, useful, and well done; the colorful plastic/silicone protects the glass and is very functional as a handle. Overall, great popper and serving bowl, it also cleans easily in the sink.

Product is perfect size for one hearty serving. Consistently pops all the kernels (assuming you don't overload it). Haven't had a single burnt popped kernel yet. The lid has holes for butter to melt through during popping; however, the butter melts completely before the popping starts, then pools at the bottom to become a dark brown coating on the glass (hence 4 stars rather than 5). Better to melt the butter separately and add it to the popcorn later.Plus, it's just darn cute.

There is nothing to dislike about this product. If you have burned yourself opening as hot bag of steaming popcorn and then finding your popcorn is burned? Those days are over! It takes a few minutes longer to pop than a paper bag but once it gets going you can actually watch the kernels. Important! Don't over fill or the popcorn will get kind of jammed together inside the container, and you'll need a spatula to loosen it up. The glass container doesn't  get dangerously hot like a paper bag does. The learning curve with this thing is very short. Always use the lid/cup to measure out your servings. The more butter you use the longer it takes to pop. Never stop and restart! Buy best quality popcorn! Cleans up easily! You will never use the paper bag again. This is the final word in popcorn makers.

I love popcorn! But I don't care for the microwave bags full of unhealthy additives. This is a game changer and it works beautifully. You have to monitor the first couple of times to make adjustments for your microwave. I did burn a little at first. But it is so simple and great!

So‚?¶I bought the larger model of this popper.  Instructions say to add 2 capfuls of popcorn and let it go until most of the popping dies down.  It ran for 3m 20s before I stopped it.The corn that had popped first was burnt.One cap would do fine, two caps just takes too long and that‚??s why I give it a 3.  Had I known this would be the result, I would have saved a few bucks and bought the smaller one.  As it is, I‚??ll be popping less despite the larger capacity so it isn‚??t burnt.The butter on the top, melting over the popping corn is ingenius by concept‚?¶less so in actual use.  The butter melts quickly and ends up in the pot before much corn has popped.  Some pieces benefitted but not as many as one would hope.The handle was cool to the touch coming out of the microwave and the popcorn poured right out into my bowl.  Better than 3/4ths of the corn was popped (more than even a bag).  I used a brand new jar of Orville Redenbacher‚??s to test.

I love everything about this. I love that my popcorn is being popped inside a glass container (the only plastic being the tiny lid at the top). I love that it‚??s full proof. It pops my popcorn in three minutes, with about 10 kernels left unpopped. That‚??s a very good ratio. I love that I don‚??t have to pop my popcorn with oil anymore, making it a healthier snack. (I sprinkle cinnamon on my popcorn and just the tiniest smidgen of salt, so I tell myself it‚??s health food, LOL.) Anyway, this thing works like a dream. Perfect for a generous serving for one person (but I suspect for two people you might want two cycles with it). Just buy it, you won‚??t regret it. PS-I got the pale aqua color, which is really lovely, but there are lots of other colors as well. Whatever floats your boat!

With this microwave popcorn popper, I finally figured out how to pop my popcorn without burning it. Use water instead of oil or butter. That's right, water! I could never seem to pop my popcorn with oil or butter without burning it and end up having to throw it away.Put about 2 tablespoons of water in the popper (don't add butter or oil), add popcorn kernels to cover the bottom, place the lid on the popper, and place the popper in the microwave to pop the corn.I use the popcorn setting on my microwave, all microwaves are different so you will have to figure out how much time works for you. After your popcorn is popped you can add melted butter and enjoy.You're welcome ??Å

First of all it's cute. I got the smaller one which is perfect for one or two people. You have complete control of the amount of oil and salt as opposed to microwave popcorn in the bag. The first couple of times I used the measure in the lid for the amount of kernels but then increased it because it only gave me a half of a bowl of popcorn. If you measure the amount of kernels by filling the lid it will give you a full container of popcorn. The silicone wrap around it takes the little out of the worry breaking the glass. The handle stays cool.

Game changer experience! The Gaiatop Portable Hand Held Fan emerges as a versatile and efficient solution for those in need of a compact cooling device. Equipped with a USB rechargeable 2000mAh battery, this fan is designed for both convenience and performance.  One of the things I love is that it fits comfortably in a purse, tote or backpack.One of the standout features of this fan is its battery life. On a full charge, the fan can last several hours, even at higher speeds. The USB charging feature is particularly convenient, allowing you to charge it via a laptop, power bank, or any standard USB charger. The battery indicator is a thoughtful addition, keeping you informed of the remaining charge.The fan is straightforward to use with an intuitive button control that adjusts the speed. It also includes a small base that can attach to the bottom, allowing it to stand on a flat surface for hands-free operation. This dual functionality enhances its utility, making it more than just a handheld fan.While the fan is generally effective, it might not be suitable for those needing extensive cooling over large areas due to its compact size. Also, while the build is sturdy, the fan's plastic components may not endure rough handling over time.Overall, the Gaiatop Portable Hand Held Fan is a reliable, handy accessory for anyone looking to stay cool on the go. Its combination of effective performance, good battery life, and portable design makes it a worthwhile investment for everyday use and travel. It strikes a good balance between functionality and convenience, making it a recommended choice for personal cooling needs.

If you are looking for a two in one easy to carry around with you and doesn't take up space in a bag/purse this is the product for you. I do not have pictures unfortunately but I was recommended this product from a friend of mine; I loved hers and decided to get my own. I brought this to a concert with me only used the portable part more than the fan bcuz luckily the venue was well air conditioned. Fan is a little lousy but it's easy to tune it out. Charger port did last me a good while for me so I'm thankful for that bcuz not a lot of portable charges have a big enough battery. I love this product and would buy it again if I needed to

Bought this for vacation but didn‚??t use it as much as I thought I would. It works well, is super quiet and is small & compact so super easy to carry around. I didn‚??t use it as a portable charger only because I didn‚??t need it but loved having the option without having to carry something separate! I did test it out to make sure it worked and it charged my phone for the minute I had to plugged in. I don‚??t know how long the battery life is just because I haven‚??t used it a ton, maybe 5-6 times but I will say I haven‚??t had to charge it again and I bought it over a month ago! Super cute color & design too so extra points for that.

Quick charge, compact, good air flow. It was nice to have during an MLB game.HOWEVER! One should be very mindful of the open blades. Especially when consuming a few ballpark beers (they just hit different). Once, while conversing with my fellow attendee, my hand got too close to my head and my hair got caught in the fan.

I purchases my daughter the pink one a year or so ago and she loves it for hot cruise days, hot beach time, anytime a fan can be used! It's such a bonus to be able to charge her phone if needed too. So I thought, what the heck, let me but one for our next cruise.I tested it out to check how fast it charged my phone and it was meh, nowhere near fast charging, but hey in a punch you take what you can get right. We'll, my husband walks in and says omg what is that noise! He can hear those high pitched noises like a dog can hear a whistle. He found it was the charger. I go closer and can hear it too. I assumed it was defective but hey, we have a year old one so I tried that and same thing after a few minutes.Now, my daughter has an iPhone and I have an android. I know I phones don't charge as fast as androids, so it may be that my phone is trying to pull too much charge and hers isn't. So, she's fine with hers, but I returned it and purchased a different variety that doesn't kill my husband's ears when I charge my phone with it.Would I recommend? If you're an iPhone user, yes, most definitely. Android? No, go with the JisuLife one as it doesn't give the high pitched noise that will drive any babies/pets/sensitive husband's crazy. They have one that's 4500mAh,its bigger but also so much stronger (white fan in the photos)White fan (other brand sucks at balance when closed, no matter how you lie it down when closed it wants to aggressively flip to have usb openings facing upPink fan (this brand) has mini fins that kinda hold it in place so no rolling aroundPink fan wants to walk off the table when using it on Max speed.

Purchased one for my daughter for our Italy and Greece trip. Loved it so much, I got one too! This is a MUST HAVE item! Not just for travel, but to keep in your purse at all times! lol! It has come in handy so, so many times and people are always commenting they wish they had one and asking where did I get it! I would not have survived our summer without this. I use it everyday..outside, inside. Anytime I‚??m in line, or just need some cooling off. Lifesaver!  we loved them! Stays charged for a long time and fast! It makes minimal noise, and I love my white one, while my daughter has the pink color. Cleans easily and are good quality. Very very happy with my purchase and would buy from again.

It's really cute.  Although because it's so compact, I could see how it might be a little challenging to open for some people.  If you don't want your small kids messing with it though, they may not be able to figure it out, so that's nice.I love the soft blades, so no chance of fingers being caught or hurt.  I really like the color, although I would have loved it in a deep purple too.Definitely does the job as I am a woman of a particular age ??? and have hot flashes.  I also appreciate that it does have two speeds.  It's a welcome addition to my life.

I bought this little fan honestly because of the color, ??? I was pleasantly surprised that while sitting pool side I was able to keep sweat off my face! This will be perfect for cruises! It‚??s not loud, it‚??s not heavy, it‚??s rechargeable, it packs just enough power that it won‚??t chop off your finger but you can pleasantly enjoy a nice steady breeze! Love that it came with a lanyard clip too! People said it was hard to open.. I had no issues as you can see in the video..

It works great for hot flashes. But you need it with you all the time. I was packing it in my pocket most of the time on our vacation. I didn't want to pack my purse with me everywhere, Its a little bulky for a pocket. (glad I had it) Small and powerful. Wouldn't have survived our vacation with out it.  Charge lasted all day and gose with me just about everywhere now.

Game changer experience! The Gaiatop Portable Hand Held Fan emerges as a versatile and efficient solution for those in need of a compact cooling device. Equipped with a USB rechargeable 2000mAh battery, this fan is designed for both convenience and performance.  One of the things I love is that it fits comfortably in a purse, tote or backpack.One of the standout features of this fan is its battery life. On a full charge, the fan can last several hours, even at higher speeds. The USB charging feature is particularly convenient, allowing you to charge it via a laptop, power bank, or any standard USB charger. The battery indicator is a thoughtful addition, keeping you informed of the remaining charge.The fan is straightforward to use with an intuitive button control that adjusts the speed. It also includes a small base that can attach to the bottom, allowing it to stand on a flat surface for hands-free operation. This dual functionality enhances its utility, making it more than just a handheld fan.While the fan is generally effective, it might not be suitable for those needing extensive cooling over large areas due to its compact size. Also, while the build is sturdy, the fan's plastic components may not endure rough handling over time.Overall, the Gaiatop Portable Hand Held Fan is a reliable, handy accessory for anyone looking to stay cool on the go. Its combination of effective performance, good battery life, and portable design makes it a worthwhile investment for everyday use and travel. It strikes a good balance between functionality and convenience, making it a recommended choice for personal cooling needs.

If you are looking for a two in one easy to carry around with you and doesn't take up space in a bag/purse this is the product for you. I do not have pictures unfortunately but I was recommended this product from a friend of mine; I loved hers and decided to get my own. I brought this to a concert with me only used the portable part more than the fan bcuz luckily the venue was well air conditioned. Fan is a little lousy but it's easy to tune it out. Charger port did last me a good while for me so I'm thankful for that bcuz not a lot of portable charges have a big enough battery. I love this product and would buy it again if I needed to

Bought this for vacation but didn‚??t use it as much as I thought I would. It works well, is super quiet and is small & compact so super easy to carry around. I didn‚??t use it as a portable charger only because I didn‚??t need it but loved having the option without having to carry something separate! I did test it out to make sure it worked and it charged my phone for the minute I had to plugged in. I don‚??t know how long the battery life is just because I haven‚??t used it a ton, maybe 5-6 times but I will say I haven‚??t had to charge it again and I bought it over a month ago! Super cute color & design too so extra points for that.

Quick charge, compact, good air flow. It was nice to have during an MLB game.HOWEVER! One should be very mindful of the open blades. Especially when consuming a few ballpark beers (they just hit different). Once, while conversing with my fellow attendee, my hand got too close to my head and my hair got caught in the fan. Not a big chunk, but those side pieces you pull down from your ball cap to look cute. There was no way to detangle that mess so I had to rip it from my skull. I was given another ballpark beer, and a hot dog, to dull my pain.THEN...the game was getting close. Cubs looked like they were about to rally. So many cheers. Loud shouting. Booing the Cubs fans in our row. Aggressive hand gestures. You know the drill. Top of the 9th, Reds leading 4-3. Wilson pitches to Ian Happ with 1 out. Happ fouls it straight up towards Reds dugout. Tyler Stephenson runs towards it, throws his mask, and makes A SLIDING CATCH FOR THE OUT! It. Was. Beautiful.

This unit extends a standard duplex AC plug to 5 standard outlets plus 4 USB charging ports--2 USBA and 2 USBC. It even has an attractive built-in night light that you can enable/disable. Although, the night light only has a light sensor; it does not have a motion sensor, so it is either on when it's dark or it isn't.The only reason I didn't give the unit 5 stars is because it doesn't mount flush against the wall. It sticks out about an 1/8"", which means it wobbles around on the outlet when you plug in an AC cord unless you hold it. I had a unit that did flush mount but the USB ports died after the first power outage, so that was a no-go.The unit was quite easy to install but I wouldn't recommend it for traveling. You don't want to be taking a faceplate off of an outlet in a hotel!

This has been super handy near by bedside as it has a light ring that pops on when you turn the lights off, like a mini night light. It makes it easy to see which cord you're grabbing in the dark as well. It was well worth the price. Been using a few weeks now and it's been awesome. So wish I would have gotten this sooner. The plugs do seem a hit hard to push in, but I'm assuming that's a safety feature and is only a hassle if trying to plug something in at a weird angle. USB ports seem to charge at a good rate of speed too.

Sturdy outer packaging so the item wasn't damaged during shipping (UPS here likes to throw boxes around and they get crushed).Contents include the extender and a piece of paper showing how to disable the night light (very helpful because the night light button is a touch sensor so there is no physical button - I wouldn't have figured this out myself).Only 2 screwdrivers needed: a flathead (to remove the screw from my original outlet) and a Philips (to secure this extender in place). Quick tip: I stored the original outlet screw inside the little hole where the extender screw is and put a small piece of tape over it. My outlet's original screw fits perfectly inside that little cubby hole and I'll have it ready in case I want to remove the extender in the future.I tried screwing in the extender 2 different ways - with the outlet wall plate on and the outlet wall plate off. The extender fit no matter what. I left the wall plate on because the extender will not cover the gap between the extender and wall so dust can get in between.Working great out of the box so far.

I used 4 AC plugs and one USB-C. It does not have a button to turn light on or off. The light will automatically turn on at night. I use the USB-C to charge my phone at night, and I don't see any flickering light. It is just a regular night light. I have a feeling that USB-C charge faster than USB-A.

I am a sucker for technology. When I read Plasma Arch Electric Candle Lighter, I was hooked.As soon as the season changes and the sun is down before dinner, we break out the candles and the stick matches. My wife is a gourmet cook, lucky me. My job is to pair the wine, choose the music, set the table, and light the candles. We also throw dinner parties, and setting the table for twelve is not unusual.Now, about the Fukkuda lighter. The first time I used it, I was sold. It works by passing the arch of electricity over the candle's wick, and then, poof, there is flame. It puts on a show if you have never seen anything like this before. My wife, who has no interest in technology, was even impressed. It's an elegant little electronic device that is easy to use with a simple button push. Also, the lighter has become my party trick when we have dinner parties. Everyone is impressed. Fun!In addition, this is simply the best way to light a candle.

i blind bought this because i am constantly lighting candles and am SO FREAKING TIRED of the normal candle lighters running out of fuel and having to click click click to get the tiniest flame going.i saw this had good reviews, was rechargeable, and honestly just seemed cool. when you ""light this"", it's not like your typical lighter. it literally looks like a taser electricity is running between the the two little ""sticks.""my only complaint is that this does NOT come with a charger (WHY?????), and you can ONLY use a charger that is 3A max and not a fast charger at all. luckily i already had one at home. so, just know this before buying that you're going to be annoyed if you don't have a charger block when this arrives.this thing charges super fast, works amazing, and i will absolutely buy another one of these if/when this one fails. fantastic product!will update review if anything changes.

First time using an electronic lighter to start a campfire and have to say it works pretty good. Wind does not effect it compared to a regular butane lighter. Overall I really like this, but there are a few minor issue for me to deduct 1 star.1. The slide switch is loose. When sliding to the on/off position it does not lock into place. Mines will move around and if the switch is not in the on position  the plasma flame will not come on. Have to make sure I push it up before pressing the button.2. The plasma flame is slightly small with only 1 and there is like a 10-15sec limit that it stays on for before powering off. Also the width of the arc is narrow. A few millimeters wider and it would be better to light small branches and wood.For the price this works great. But if I have to do it again I would suggest getting one that has more than 1 plasma arc and a little bigger.Oh yeah this is an electric light so if you use it near metal it will cut out as a safety. I accidentally got to close to the metal grill and short out my lighter. All let's went off and lighter would not work. But after plugging it into a USB charger the lights came back on and all works normally. Good to know that there is a safety protection built in :)

Overall I've really enjoyed this lighter. The battery life has surprised me, its easy to operate, and its got a cool safety switch design. I got it because I was tired of my conventional fireplace and candle lighters running out of fuel.The only downside I've run into is that the gap between the electrodes is a bit more narrow than I'd like. New, slender candle wicks will fit in there just fine. But as some wicks burn, they get a bit chunky with residue, and have a hard time fitting. You'll end up with residue on the electrodes themselves from making contact with the wicks, which you have to wipe off periodically.Not a huge issue or deal breaker at all, especially considering the price! The only other thing I'd call out is you may need to hold the arc on a wick a bit longer than you'd guess for the flame to really take. Again, we're talking seconds. Not a big issue, just something that I had to learn as I used it.Fun product. :)

I will admit, I was hoping I could use this the same as a regular lighter, but it only will really work on candles. Maybe it would work to light lint on fire, but I gave up on trying to light a campfire. Works great for candles.

I'm obsessed with candles, I love them, have them everywhere on our main level. I light them every night.  I can't help it, it's sort of a problem.  Well, I came across this gadget one day and decided to give it a try.  It's awesome.  It keeps a charge for a long time, it charges quickly via USB, it's safe, and it's kind of fun to use.  I'm not a pyro, but if I were, I think this would be the tool I'd use.  I love it.

i blind bought this because i am constantly lighting candles and am SO FREAKING TIRED of the normal candle lighters running out of fuel and having to click click click to get the tiniest flame going.i saw this had good reviews, was rechargeable, and honestly just seemed cool. when you ""light this"", it's not like your typical lighter. it literally looks like a taser electricity is running between the the two little ""sticks.""my only complaint is that this does NOT come with a charger (WHY?????), and you can ONLY use a charger that is 3A max and not a fast charger at all. luckily i already had one at home. so, just know this before buying that you're going to be annoyed if you don't have a charger block when this arrives.this thing charges super fast, works amazing, and i will absolutely buy another one of these if/when this one fails. fantastic product!will update review if anything changes.

First time using an electronic lighter to start a campfire and have to say it works pretty good. Wind does not effect it compared to a regular butane lighter. Overall I really like this, but there are a few minor issue for me to deduct 1 star.1. The slide switch is loose. When sliding to the on/off position it does not lock into place. Mines will move around and if the switch is not in the on position  the plasma flame will not come on. Have to make sure I push it up before pressing the button.2. The plasma flame is slightly small with only 1 and there is like a 10-15sec limit that it stays on for before powering off. Also the width of the arc is narrow. A few millimeters wider and it would be better to light small branches and wood.For the price this works great. But if I have to do it again I would suggest getting one that has more than 1 plasma arc and a little bigger.Oh yeah this is an electric light so if you use it near metal it will cut out as a safety. I accidentally got to close to the metal grill and short out my lighter. All let's went off and lighter would not work. But after plugging it into a USB charger the lights came back on and all works normally. Good to know that there is a safety protection built in :)

Overall I've really enjoyed this lighter. The battery life has surprised me, its easy to operate, and its got a cool safety switch design. I got it because I was tired of my conventional fireplace and candle lighters running out of fuel.The only downside I've run into is that the gap between the electrodes is a bit more narrow than I'd like. New, slender candle wicks will fit in there just fine. But as some wicks burn, they get a bit chunky with residue, and have a hard time fitting. You'll end up with residue on the electrodes themselves from making contact with the wicks, which you have to wipe off periodically.Not a huge issue or deal breaker at all, especially considering the price! The only other thing I'd call out is you may need to hold the arc on a wick a bit longer than you'd guess for the flame to really take. Again, we're talking seconds. Not a big issue, just something that I had to learn as I used it.Fun product. :)

I recently purchased this retractable car charger with 100W power specifically designed for double iPhones, yes, I have two, and I must say, it has exceeded my expectations in terms of functionality and convenience.One of the key features is the fast charging capability. With 100W power output, it charges my iPhones quickly, which is incredibly convenient, especially when I'm on the go and need a quick power boost.The dual charging ports are fantastic, allowing me to charge both my iPhones simultaneously without any decrease in charging speed.What stands out is the retractable cables. They not only eliminate cable clutter but also keep the car interior tidy and organized. The retractable design is a game-changer for me as it prevents tangled cables and makes storing the charger hassle-free.The two additional ports are particularly handy when I'm traveling with a passenger who also needs to charge their device.Furthermore, it plugs snuggly into the cigarette socket ensuring a secure connection, so I never have to worry about the charger coming loose while driving.Overall, I highly recommend this item to anyone looking for a reliable, fast-charging solution for their vehicles. It's sleek, efficient, and delivers on its promises, making it a must-have accessory for any car owner. I bought an additional four for my family as stocking stuffers!

I love this charger! I have a manual shift Jeep, and was constantly battling charger cords laying all around the shift console. This charger block is a petfect solution, as they are the perfect length, and the cords disappear when not in use. The fast charging is also a huge bonus. Great product - highly recommended.

I wanted to get rid of the mess of charging cables that sits up in the front of my car. This device provides a neat and tidy way of storing both a lightning cable and a USB-C cable, as well as providing extra charging ports.It's a solid unit and feels sturdy, should last a long time.Just note that the retractable cables are somewhat short (80cm or about 2.5ft). It's enough for passengers in the front seat, but will not reach the backseat.My only complaint is that the included retractable cables do not fast charge my phone. Using a thicker cable in the extra USB ports will fast charge your phone if needed though, so it's not the end of the world.

At last, I don't have a mess of cables in my car for my charging needs. I absolutely love this product. The retractable cables keep everything nice, neat and clean. And the additional plugs allow me to charge my watch. The fact that it tilts once it's inserted into the outlet is great for improved accessibility. It's so good. I'm buying one for the motorhome and another one for our other vehicle.

The pull-out charge cables are great, I don't have to worry if my cables are in the vehicle anymore. They work as described. The adjustability of angles is great. Having the volt meter on it is not only great just to have and make sure it's connected properly, but it helps to see how your vehicle's charging system is working.  I could see fluctuations from the start of the vehicle's current battery level, to while driving, and I know my alternator is putting out what it's supposed to.

This is great for the car as it swivels in nearly any direction. My only issue is that the connector is a bit hard to get a hold of when you want to pull it from the fully retracted position. I think a small thumb tab sticking out from each of the two connectors would make it easier to use. But overall, great job.

This was our first time using the mini donut maker since I purchased it several months ago.  My son had been asking for donuts and I kept forgetting.  I love traditional frosted and glazed donuts, not a fan really of cake donuts.  I wanted to try a yeast recipe but I haven't yet.  I used a box of Duncan Hines Moist Yellow Cake mix and prepared it according to the box instructions. I used chocolate frosting for some and made a glaze with powdered sugar, a little vanilla extract, salt and milk for the others.  I dipped about half the glazed donuts in sprinkles.  The don't maker gets very hot pretty quickly. I didn't spray the inside with oil though the instructions recommend you do, they still came out rather easily.  I used a mini spatula. These require a lie of hands on attention. I piped the donuts in the maker using a piping bag.  Let them bake up to 1.5 minutes and then flipped them, I think 1 minute to 1 minute 15 sec was best.  Then let them bake another minute. Then gently slip the mini spatula in there top scoop them out. They didn't stick at all. Then I allowed them to cool a few minutes and topped them to suit kids tastes. It was fun and using the cake mix turned out much better than I expected.  It wasn't too much like a cupcake and wasn't as dense as a cake donut, they actually seemed like bakery donuts almost. I had no trouble cleaning.  After it cooled down I just wiped it off with a damp cloth.  I think the design is pretty cute.  I have a cart that I stock all my novelty kitchen appliances in. It doesn't take up a lot of space but it isn't something I would use regularly.  Just for fun.  These would be fun to bring in for coworkers to enjoy, my kids had fun sharing them with their friends.

I have wanted to get one of these for a while now but just never got around to it. Finally I decided on this one (thanks Amazon review family) and let me tell you. I LOVE IT!First impressions, the color blue/aqua matches all my other retro-y stuff which is the same color. For some that might not be a thing but for me it is hehe.It heats up very quickly and even on a first time heat up there was very little to no ""new device"" smell.The first thing I tried was using both a lemon and a chocolate cake mix. I was looking for a substantial amount of mini donuts and a flavor choice.The instructions suggest flipping at about a minute and a half and then cooking for up to another 3 mins. I noticed the chocolate mix seemed to cook a bit faster. Also, after doing it a couple times you kind of get a sense of when to flip them.It recommends using a toothpick and I can see why! I didn't have any so had to use a skewer and it did make some holes when flipping. So I will invest in toothpicks for future batches.The donught holes don't come out as holes (maybe this is a learning curve idk) but I solved that problem with a simple cone loader (if you know you know) the hole is the PERFECT size to punch out the donut holes lol.Even with only making a few at a time, it's a simple task and before long you have a LOT of donuts. One cake mix box will make idk, maybe like 30 of them? It's hard to say because we were eating them as fast as I could pump them out!They come out not really like donuts, more like little mini cakes and are quite delish. Overall a total win 10/10 recommend

You could say I am a microscopy enthusiast.  I wanted a scope to use when I'm out with my kids.  I wanted something that my 5 year old could use, but powerful enough that we could all enjoy it.  I suspect a lot of buyers might be thinking the same thing, so here's my thoughts on using this with young kids.I purchased the following portable microscopes/magnifiers and tried them all out:* Carson MicroMini 20x LED Lighted Pocket Microscope (MM-280B) ** THIS ITEM *** Carson MicroBrite Plus 60x-120x Power LED Lighted Pocket Microscope (MM-300)* Carson 60X-75X MicroMax LED Lighted Pocket Microscope (MM-200)* Carson 10x LumiLoupe (LL10)I included a picture for size comparison.For our intended use, I expect to get the most use from the MM-280B.  The magnification is good enough to suprise you with what you see, revealing details that are still small enough to be unexpected and exciting.  Yet it is still easy enough to use that my 5 year old can use it with some help.It's super easy to focus and very small, smaller than expected.  It's the smallest of the scopes I tried by a large margin.  The LED is bright enough to use it even in the dark and still get a good image.  Batteries were included.I found that with the other, higher magnification, scopes it was too hard to focus and share with my kids -- even extremely tiny movements in my hand would consistently cause the image to shift or knocked out of focus.  It was too hard to get an image and share it with my kids on those scopes, even at their lowest magnification.  The MM-300 in particular was AMAZING in terms of image, but it isn't great for sharing.  I will keep that one to myself. :-)On this scope, the 20x magnification was good enough to see plenty of detail and still be able to share it with each other without losing focus.  The LL10 was obviously super easy to share since no focusing is required and the field-of-view on that one is HUGE.  Unfortunately, the loupes only go up to 10x and that does not seem to be quite enough magnification to impress the kids (let alone adult myself).  If there was a Carson 20x pre-focused loupe, I'd try that out, but the off-brand options I could find looked pretty low-quality.I wasn't too big on having UV, but as it turned out this is somewhat useful already.  A number of the minerals we have found already are UV reactive.The only drawback is that this thing won't actually survive on my keychain.  It does seem very durable, but I am confident it would eventually be scratched or rendered inoperable if it were to become part of my ""everyday carry"" and endure frequent nicks and bumps.  I need to look into some sort of small case or something.  A lens cap/cover to protect the optics from my keys would make this ideal.The other scopes were great for other purposes but I think that if you are planning to let your kids use this, this one is a good choice.  If you want something that a 5-year old (or younger) can use without any help at all, then the LL10 is a good choice but they probably won't be amazed by the details they discover, it will be more of a ""mildly interesting"" reaction with the LL10.  The others have more impressive magnification, but will be hard for kids to use.  This one was a great middle ground.

Because I thought it would look as big as it felt, I combed my hair believing it would drop in the (white) sink.I shed a lot of hair & my hair is very long.

Those specks were about the size of an 1/8th of a pinhead, or even smaller!I got curious, and not only wanted to see in the micro mini what that black specks were, but TEST the mini for the first time! (I was NOT thinking at all about the embedded thing I had just removed.)Upon placing the specks on a piece of white paper, I secured them with a piece of clear tape. Then proceeded to look at them under the mini microscope.OMG it looks like a SPIDER split in two!!! But, to me, it has too many legs. All spiders have 8legs & I counted 12. To me, it‚??s mind blowing HOW BIG THEY LOOK!!! (Assuming it‚??s two spiders & not one.) Now, I wonder & will research how much smaller could some baby spiders be?Later on, I remembered that the previous day I had sat at my favorite spot; on a bench under a tree.I highly recommend this Micro Mini! It is much, much more than what I expected it to be. And having other features it‚??s totally worth the price.Go find the tiniest insect you can find & surprise yourself as you enjoy the magic of this mini microscope!

This little 20-power magnifier isn't like the other, more powerful Carson mini-microscopes. The other ones, which are more powerful, use a very tiny objective lens together with a bright LED to provide the light needed to make up for the small objective lens. In those other pocket microscopes, the small objective lens makes focusing vastly easier. This little 20x keychain magnifier uses a more conventional lens arrangement, most likely two, one the objective and the other the eyepiece. The objective lens is probably about 13 mm in diameter, which together with the 20x power means that in daylight you could do without the LED. But with the LED, you get a nice bright image regardless. The focusing isn't terribly difficult, owing to the magnification not being especially strong. All in all it is a good solution for a 20 x magnifier that you can easily carry on a keychain, if you want. The most noteworthy drawback is that the sliding switch on the side is very cheap and difficult to use. It doesn't want to move, and when it does, it wants to go all the way from one end to the other. The 'off' position is in the center; the two end positions are for the LED you use when using the magnifier, and the auxiliary LED that serves as a flashlight and gives you a reason to carry it on your keychain. It also has a little UV light, which I suppose is for when you look at rocks that glow under UV light. Or maybe for getting a close-up look at scorpions. To make the switch behave, you have to press down on it firmly and move it in a controlled manner. I'm just not sure how long it is going to last when used this way. But it doesn't cost much so if it eventually stops working it isn't a big deal, and even without the light it is a useful magnifying lens. Recommended with only the weakest of reservation.

And having other features it‚??s totally worth the price.Go find the tiniest insect you can find & surprise yourself as you enjoy the magic of this mini microscope!

This little 20-power magnifier isn't like the other, more powerful Carson mini-microscopes. The other ones, which are more powerful, use a very tiny objective lens together with a bright LED to provide the light needed to make up for the small objective lens. In those other pocket microscopes, the small objective lens makes focusing vastly easier. This little 20x keychain magnifier uses a more conventional lens arrangement, most likely two, one the objective and the other the eyepiece. The objective lens is probably about 13 mm in diameter, which together with the 20x power means that in daylight you could do without the LED. But with the LED, you get a nice bright image regardless. The focusing isn't terribly difficult, owing to the magnification not being especially strong. All in all it is a good solution for a 20 x magnifier that you can easily carry on a keychain, if you want. The most noteworthy drawback is that the sliding switch on the side is very cheap and difficult to use. It doesn't want to move, and when it does, it wants to go all the way from one end to the other. The 'off' position is in the center; the two end positions are for the LED you use when using the magnifier, and the auxiliary LED that serves as a flashlight and gives you a reason to carry it on your keychain. It also has a little UV light, which I suppose is for when you look at rocks that glow under UV light. Or maybe for getting a close-up look at scorpions. To make the switch behave, you have to press down on it firmly and move it in a controlled manner. I'm just not sure how long it is going to last when used this way. But it doesn't cost much so if it eventually stops working it isn't a big deal, and even without the light it is a useful magnifying lens. Recommended with only the weakest of reservation.

The optics are flipped. It's a difficult to focus, mirror imaged version of whatever you're trying to look at. Useless.

I bought 3 of the Carson MicroMini 20x LED Lighted Pocket Microscope with Built-in UV and LED Flashlights and gifted them to my grandchildren that were visiting and the next thing I knew they were looking at the printed dots of ink that make up pictures and words. Next, it was the bugs and other captive creatures. They even found dirt on the floor!These were a nice size, well built and having battery powered lights helped to make this item useful and entertaining.

I needed somewhere to put my water bottles. I have limited space and I needed them off my counters. These are ready to use right out of the package. I believe they can hold some weight. I put about 100 AA batteries in one of the smaller shelves, the magnet didn‚??t even budge! 2 are bigger in size than the other 2. I have 30oz water bottles in the bigger size. I think they look great. They seem pretty sturdy. I definitely recommend them! I bought them in prime day so I got a really good deal. But they are worth the money I spent!

These racks are fantastic! The magnetic backing on these hold super well to anything metal, and they don't budge at all. I haven't organized my spices yet, but I have much heavier items in them right now and it's pretty awesome how well it holds everything solidly. They even come with little plastic hooks with which one can hang pot holders or small dog. I also have spray bottles hanging off the edges, and your cat can even use them for steps to climb to the top of your refrigerator. Speaking of which, have you dusted the top of your refrigerator lately? It gets NASTY up there! Just saying.

OVERALL - Great! Very sturdy and well-made. One of the side rails isn't fully attached to the backing and is a little loose, probably will fix with gel glue and doesn't really affect the shelf structurally. Nice white coating. Aesthetically pleasing. Strong and holds small-medium items solidly. Haven't tried heavier items as the shelving isn't very deep. Small hooks are a nice bonus. BE AWARE - there are six shelves: 3 are a larger size and 3 are slightly smaller. Look at the measurement photo carefully. All six are not the same size. The first image in the Amazon series shows the shelves as spanning the width of the fridge. They are deceptively short. My fridge is the typical white drink fridge that your parents had in the garage or basement for overflow Sunny-D, Capri Sun, and beer. It's not overly wide and yet two shelves can still go side by side. These have slats so they're easy to clean but smaller items may slip through. A good buy and wroth the price. ??ç

I use these on the side of my fridge for my spices so I can use that space in my cupboard. Great for small spaces when space is at a premium. They're strong and sturdy and the magnets are also strong so they don't move. You can arrange them any way you'd like which is also helpful instead of being 1 long piece there are 4. Would definitely recommend

There isn't too much more to say about these magnetic shelves aside from that they are AWESOME! Especially if you need just a little more shelf space in your kitchen.  They are incredibly strong magnets; these babies aren't coming down any time soon.  I use them to hold some of my large sized spice bottles as I buy frequently used spices in bulk.  I only have 1/2 side of a side of my refrigerator where I can use them, but I've been able to clear out some space in my cabinet by using these shelves.  I could put one on the front of the fridge, but I think that would look a bit tacky.  If you are worried about whether they are strong enough to hold the things you have in mind for it...  don't be they will hold a significant amount of weight for their size due to the strength of their magnetic field.  Highly Recommend

Best impulse purchase ever!!! Small kitchen with literally overflowing cabinets that rain spices and tea on our heads every time we open them. I was so sick of it, so when I saw these on prime day I figured what do I have to lose? Omg...they are so well made, hold so much and don't budge under the weight. I put a full large bottle of soy sauce in one and it didn't move at all!!! My one cabinet is completely decluttered and the shelves look so darn cute too! I just came on to order a second set because I have a large fridge and can fit so much more from other cabinets. These would also be awesome for organizing medicine bottles. I was able to spread out and organize my spices, sprinkles for baking, and a bunch of other stuff. I can't say enough good things about them. Order them...you won't regret it!

I've owned four of these, and I genuinely love it. It's a great sleep mask. Good comfort, long multi-night battery life and decent sound. It even charges via USB-C, which I love. As others noted, you must position the speakers carefully for good sound, but that's easy enough. All in all, it's a solid sleep mask at a great price.However, there's one weakness, and that's why I bought four of them. The USB cable on the mask is INCREDIBLY thin. Over time, it just breaks and stops charging. Of the four I've bought, three have died that exact way.That said, I like it enough, and it's cheap enough. I've always just gotten another. It's a good mask, I just wish the charging cable could be a little more durable.

The Musicozy is almost everything I expected...almost.  It suffers from some minor flaws here and there that could be perfected.  The best parts of the mask are the main purpose, it blocks out light WELL, is very comfortable, connects more easily than I expected to bluetooth devices, charges quite fast and connects to and disconnects from charger cable very easily.  Also has pretty good volume and sound transmission (overall...see below).Except for the little electronic control box in the forehead portion and the small audio speakers and adjoining wires, the entire thing is made of superbly-soft material, very comfortable!!  The speakers are perfect because they are pretty much thin discs that transmit sound AROUND the ears rather than penetrating ear buds that would present a threat to hearing over prolonged sleep hours.  The box and the speakers sit loosely in their own built-in 'sleeves' in the well-designed cloth.  The velcro strap on the back of the head is sufficient for a wide range of head sizes.A bit of a problem arises because the speakers sit a bit loose inside their respective sleeves, causing them to sometimes fall a bit too far from the ear canals for good sound transmission while sleeping...and so one tends to tighten and adjust the whole mask portion to get the speakers to land just right.  But in doing so, another little problem becomes evident in that the curve built in to slot around the nose, doesn't curve in enough, and so the bottom edge of the mask will tend to cover the nostrils when trying to get the speakers to cover the ears.  It's a bit annoying but not unmanageable.The tiny light indicators that emanate from the plastic control box inside the mask have to shine through very tiny holes cut into the mask, sometimes these don't line up well because the box sits loosely inside its own little sleeve like the speakers do...so these lights are very hard to see, making it hard to know if its connected and charging, to make sure you have correctly plugged it in to charge or not.I bluetooth into the mask via my ipad at bedtime.  However, after getting up in the morning, when I sit at my desk, I notice my ipad refuses to play sound because it has not disconnected from the mask on its own, obviously since it doesn't know that I have gotten up.  But pressing the power button on the mask does not 'shut off' the mask or cause the ipad to disconnect from the mask.  So I have to manually ""Disconnect"" from Musicozy in order for my ipad to play sound.  It seems the power button on the mask really only serves to pair the mask to a device.Again, minor issues IMO, little bits I have gotten past enough to say that I am very happy with how this product delivers what it claims to deliver.  I helps me sleep much more soundly than I did without it.

I have very mixed feelings about this sleep mask. Pros: long battery life, fairly comfortable, pretty good black out coverage, good sound. Cons: ridiculous flashing light when on but sound is not playing. Sleep timer will say it's set but mask never turns off. Also sometimes does hurt my ears when side sleeping. I often like to fall asleep to a 60 minute podcast and the shortest sleep timer is 90 minutes. Once the podcast ends a very bright flashing light starts which obviously I can't see with the mask on but is very disturbing to my husband and dog sleeping in my bed. I also will wake up after the 90 minutes and the mask is still on and flashing away. I feel like the sleep timer worked for a while but now it just doesn't and I have to manually turn it off. I think I'll have to cover the flashing light with some electrical tape or something but the only annoying thing about doing that is that it is not obvious if it didn't shut off like it should have and may stay on and drain the battery. Overall the sleep mask is still better than another one I've tried but it definitely has its flaws. I do like that it doesn't have an audible battery dead alert that wakes you up like some masks and just turns off quietly without disrupting your sleep. I haven't really used it much for it's built in sounds but it's a nice feature to have.

This is technically 2 products in one.  An eye cover and headphones.  I plan on reviewing both pieces.  The eye cover is wide, so my eyes are completely covered.  The eye cover is comfortable, and has an additional cushion at the bottom rim that does not allow light in if the mask moves around.  There is an adjustable strap along the back, that can go pretty wide, and is made of a comfortable material that doesn't snag or get caught in your hair.  As for the speakers, the ear flaps are long and do cover the ears well, but they are hard.  The speakers have a rubber coating on them, but they are still too large to be comfortable while you sleep on your side.  Also, the speakers have to app that can be downloaded and used to control the music and a turn off point.  I don't want to have it run all night.  All in all.  They are only ok.  Not really worth it, and I have returned them for a full refund.

My sleeping the past several months has slowly gotten worse and worse. I finally broke down and asked my doctor for advice. She wanted me to try non-pharmaceutical methods before prescribing something to help me sleep. I agreed because the last time I took medication for sleeping, the daytime hangover was worse than fatigue from just not sleeping. She recommended trying a couple of apps that help put your mind in a meditative state to fall asleep to not just fall asleep but to help you stay asleep. By then, I was willing to try anything to get decent shut eye.First night of trying the app, it helped. I fell asleep easily and stayed asleep more over the night, according to my fitness monitor. The only issue was my earbuds making my ears hurt. I'm a side sleeper and it killed my ears to attempt to sleep with my ear pressed to my pillow. I told the hubby I was going to find more comfortable sleeping earphones. He told me to not go crazy, but to feel free to buy what I felt I needed. I had one pair of sleep mask headphones in my cart before I started reading reviews that stated the controls were on the side of the head and as a side sleeper, they didn't work for the reviewer. I heeded the advice and found these. I am sooooooo glad I did!!They arrived on a Wednesday. Per instructions, I immediately put them on the charger. That night I used them to listen to my app. First, I had to adjust the speakers so I could hear. Minor detail. They worked wonderfully!! I Turn them on, listen to my meditation, wake up the next morning and turn them off.I just wanted the headphones, but the sleep mask helps as well. The light from my coffee pot turning on at 4:45 am every morning no longer wakes me up. Since the strap is adjustable, I can make it to the mask barely touches my face. I don't sweat while wearing them. The only night I have so far, I tightened the mask too much. Once I loosened it, cooled right off. I've tried sleeping with masks on in the past, but they put too much pressure on my eyes. These don't!Now, a note on the battery. I know it says 8 hours of use. I'm not sure what they mean by that. 8 hours of music or whatever actually playing? 8 hours of connection to a device? I'm not sure, but I charged it for the full time as directed in the instructions. The was Wednesday, the day I received them. I did not have to charge them (because they turned off on their own) until the following week's Friday. Granted, the first couple of nights I turned them off once I woke up and the story was done, but for a week, I left them on and connected to my phone all night. For me, that translates into charging about once a week. I've had wireless headphones I used for my walks that I had to charge every third day of use. In my opinion, the battery life has amazed and impressed me! I hope it'll continue to stay that way as I use them.Okay, I might be done rambling now. To sum up, these headphones/sleep mask have been a wonderful addition to my attempt to remain off medications so I get natural sleep. I absolutely would recommend these to anyone who wants to listen to relaxing music all night or bedtime meditations or whatever you want to listen to without disturbing anyone who shares a bed with you. Great price for a great product!!

Overall, I love this sleep mask. It blocks out light well and is perfect for listening to my sleep meditation or binaural beats without disturbing my husband. I also have the headband design this brand also carries and I prefer these for the way they fit. The mask is more padded around the speakers so this design is much more comfortable for me to sleep in. I gave the headband to my husband and he does still enjoy that.A few notes...1-The speakers provide decent volume but need to be fairly well positioned to be heard. The mask tends to slide up a little bit on me as I move at night and once the speakers slide above my ears slightly I can no longer hear it. It's not a huge deal to me as I am usually asleep at this point and will simply adjust if I wake up2- The battery life is good and can usually make it a couple nights for me. It also charges pretty quickly so I can throw it on the charger 20 minutes before bed if I realized I had forgotten to charge it and that will pretty well make it through the night. However, when the battery does get low there is this obnoxious voice that cuts in every 30 seconds or so saying ""Battery Low"". That voice will wake me up if the speakers are still on my ears and has provided quite the jump scare just as I was dozing. Considering these are made for sleeping, I would be ok with the sound just fading out or a soft beep. Safe to say after having that experience a couple of times, I will make sure these are charged before bed. I do wish there was a way that the headset would tell you your battery percentage, but my phone does typically show it on the bluetooth connection.

This is surprisingly comfortable enough to sleep with. The speakers lay flat on your ears.Easy to set up. I used it less than 10x (only on trips away from home) and one night it just stopped working. I was playing white noise and two hours into the night, it just completely died on me and I was left listening to my partner snore.I came home to charge it and it never charged backed up.I guess it‚??s done.I‚??m weary to purchase again incase it craps out again but it was useful while it worked.Also wish there was a way to see the battery life on it. The light only ever shows blue when on. I wish it turned yellow when it was wearing and red when needing to be charged or something like that!

This is my second type of headband earphones and these did take a little bit to get used to. I am a side sleeper that sleeps on soft pillows in a hot/ humid climate.Pros: battery life is excellent (make sure to follow the directions exactly when charging) battery will last 12-14 hours if charged correctly.Adjustable headband is amazing, it‚??s Velcro and can be trimmed.Sound quality is decent for the price. I‚??m a light sleeper and it drowns out pretty much all background noise.I love the eye mask part more than I thought I would/ it blocks out all the lightCons: fabric is a thick velvet type material and does get hot around the faceEarphones can be uncomfortable and leave your ears feeling sore. If this happens just loosen the Velcro. My ears were sore for about a week but I haven‚??t had any issues after.

This is technically 2 products in one.  An eye cover and headphones.  I plan on reviewing both pieces.  The eye cover is wide, so my eyes are completely covered.  The eye cover is comfortable, and has an additional cushion at the bottom rim that does not allow light in if the mask moves around.  There is an adjustable strap along the back, that can go pretty wide, and is made of a comfortable material that doesn't snag or get caught in your hair.  As for the speakers, the ear flaps are long and do cover the ears well, but they are hard.  The speakers have a rubber coating on them, but they are still too large to be comfortable while you sleep on your side.  Also, the speakers have to app that can be downloaded and used to control the music and a turn off point.  I don't want to have it run all night.  All in all.  They are only ok.  Not really worth it, and I have returned them for a full refund.

My favorite feature on the mask is the cooling eye gel about the eyes. It feels so good around my eyes without putting pressure on my lid.It blacks out all light.Sound is great.Color is perfectI am definitely going to consider this for gifts for family and friends.

My sleeping the past several months has slowly gotten worse and worse. I finally broke down and asked my doctor for advice. She wanted me to try non-pharmaceutical methods before prescribing something to help me sleep. I agreed because the last time I took medication for sleeping, the daytime hangover was worse than fatigue from just not sleeping. She recommended trying a couple of apps that help put your mind in a meditative state to fall asleep to not just fall asleep but to help you stay asleep. By then, I was willing to try anything to get decent shut eye.First night of trying the app, it helped. I fell asleep easily and stayed asleep more over the night, according to my fitness monitor. The only issue was my earbuds making my ears hurt. I'm a side sleeper and it killed my ears to attempt to sleep with my ear pressed to my pillow. I told the hubby I was going to find more comfortable sleeping earphones. He told me to not go crazy, but to feel free to buy what I felt I needed. I had one pair of sleep mask headphones in my cart before I started reading reviews that stated the controls were on the side of the head and as a side sleeper, they didn't work for the reviewer. I heeded the advice and found these. I am sooooooo glad I did!!They arrived on a Wednesday. Per instructions, I immediately put them on the charger. That night I used them to listen to my app. First, I had to adjust the speakers so I could hear. Minor detail. They worked wonderfully!! I Turn them on, listen to my meditation, wake up the next morning and turn them off.I just wanted the headphones, but the sleep mask helps as well. The light from my coffee pot turning on at 4:45 am every morning no longer wakes me up. Since the strap is adjustable, I can make it to the mask barely touches my face. I don't sweat while wearing them. The only night I have so far, I tightened the mask too much. Once I loosened it, cooled right off. I've tried sleeping with masks on in the past, but they put too much pressure on my eyes. These don't!Now, a note on the battery. I know it says 8 hours of use. I'm not sure what they mean by that. 8 hours of music or whatever actually playing? 8 hours of connection to a device? I'm not sure, but I charged it for the full time as directed in the instructions. The was Wednesday, the day I received them. I did not have to charge them (because they turned off on their own) until the following week's Friday. Granted, the first couple of nights I turned them off once I woke up and the story was done, but for a week, I left them on and connected to my phone all night. For me, that translates into charging about once a week. I've had wireless headphones I used for my walks that I had to charge every third day of use. In my opinion, the battery life has amazed and impressed me! I hope it'll continue to stay that way as I use them.Okay, I might be done rambling now. To sum up, these headphones/sleep mask have been a wonderful addition to my attempt to remain off medications so I get natural sleep. I absolutely would recommend these to anyone who wants to listen to relaxing music all night or bedtime meditations or whatever you want to listen to without disturbing anyone who shares a bed with you. Great price for a great product!!

Overall, I love this sleep mask. It blocks out light well and is perfect for listening to my sleep meditation or binaural beats without disturbing my husband. I also have the headband design this brand also carries and I prefer these for the way they fit. The mask is more padded around the speakers so this design is much more comfortable for me to sleep in. I gave the headband to my husband and he does still enjoy that.A few notes...1-The speakers provide decent volume but need to be fairly well positioned to be heard. The mask tends to slide up a little bit on me as I move at night and once the speakers slide above my ears slightly I can no longer hear it. It's not a huge deal to me as I am usually asleep at this point and will simply adjust if I wake up2- The battery life is good and can usually make it a couple nights for me. It also charges pretty quickly so I can throw it on the charger 20 minutes before bed if I realized I had forgotten to charge it and that will pretty well make it through the night. However, when the battery does get low there is this obnoxious voice that cuts in every 30 seconds or so saying ""Battery Low"". That voice will wake me up if the speakers are still on my ears and has provided quite the jump scare just as I was dozing. Considering these are made for sleeping, I would be ok with the sound just fading out or a soft beep. Safe to say after having that experience a couple of times, I will make sure these are charged before bed. I do wish there was a way that the headset would tell you your battery percentage, but my phone does typically show it on the bluetooth connection.

This is surprisingly comfortable enough to sleep with. The speakers lay flat on your ears.Easy to set up. I used it less than 10x (only on trips away from home) and one night it just stopped working. I was playing white noise and two hours into the night, it just completely died on me and I was left listening to my partner snore.I came home to charge it and it never charged backed up.I guess it‚??s done.I‚??m weary to purchase again incase it craps out again but it was useful while it worked.Also wish there was a way to see the battery life on it. The light only ever shows blue when on. I wish it turned yellow when it was wearing and red when needing to be charged or something like that!

This is my second type of headband earphones and these did take a little bit to get used to. I am a side sleeper that sleeps on soft pillows in a hot/ humid climate.Pros: battery life is excellent (make sure to follow the directions exactly when charging) battery will last 12-14 hours if charged correctly.Adjustable headband is amazing, it‚??s Velcro and can be trimmed.Sound quality is decent for the price. I‚??m a light sleeper and it drowns out pretty much all background noise.I love the eye mask part more than I thought I would/ it blocks out all the lightCons: fabric is a thick velvet type material and does get hot around the faceEarphones can be uncomfortable and leave your ears feeling sore. If this happens just loosen the Velcro. My ears were sore for about a week but I haven‚??t had any issues after.

I use it to mix a powdered medicine in juice and it does the trick.  Also use it to make chocolate milk.  It's small but mighty.  To get it to mix well bring the end almost to the top of your liquid; you'll see a downward funnel and the powder get mixed in.  If you leave it there near the top it will make a nice froth in your chocolate milk.  I don't do that with the medicine though.

It works well and all 3 speeds really help on a hot day. It‚??s not too loud but I find speed 2 and 3 to be a little too loud when in a group trying to listen. The blowers are not adjustable as it says. Sure you can open it up to get it on but it springs right back into its original position. The air blows directly up so it blows into my ears. Also the vents on the neck do not blow at the same speed at those in the front. I wear it all the time. It is very comfortable and I will run it for 10-15 minutes at a time then shut it off until I need it again. I do find it helpful just wish I could direct the blowers. I would buy it again it is a good value for the money and helps when I‚??m hot.

This neck fan does the basics reasonably well ‚?? it bends, it blows, it‚??s quiet, it lasts, and most of all, it cooled me.  But I noted several points that would benefit from improvement.  If you‚??re looking for just the basics at an affordable price, then you‚??ll probably be happy with this one.  If you‚??re looking for a well-designed product, this one is not there yet.  Maybe the seller will pass these suggestions back to the manufacturer.This neck fan is ill suited to larger necks.  My neck measure 17 ¬Ω (shirt size) and while this fan does fit around my neck, it will not stay in a U shape as my neck presses it outwards.  I would guess that it would fit someone with a neck size of 15 or below (1 inch less diameter) very well, resting comfortably where it not easily fall off.  On me, I found myself worrying that it would fall off if I did anything more energetic than walking.  In fact, it did fall off a couple times at Disneyland, but they always do remind you to hold onto those hats and glasses!  Having said all that, it still blows the air effectively in just about any position it was in.  I liked how the bendy part between the two fans on each side allowed me twist the fans as well as make them narrower/wider ‚?? Twisting is a bit plus in getting the air to just the right spots.The seller touts that it is quiet at 40db.  It sounds to like that might be a realistic claim on the low speed as it is fairly quiet.  However, after a couple hours of use, I noticed that I could not hear people as well as I thought I should.  Turning off the fan made a dramatic improvement in my ability to hear.  For my needs, the low setting was enough 95% of the time.  Occasionally, like when chasing after kids on Pirates Island, I would have a lot of heat built up and then, for maybe 10 minutes, I would use a higher fan speed.  Which is a long winded way of saying that one or two slower speeds would be appreciated.The seller claims 4-16 hours run time.  I did not get near that.  On slow speed, I would only get about 8-9 hours.  Part of this may be a finicky charging design.  This will not work with a high power, true USB C, charger.  It works just fine with style that has a USB C on one end of the cable and USB A on the other.  Luckily, I had an older one around to use for this.  I also observed an oddity when charging it overnight.  (BTW, the charge light only lights us when charging ‚?? no light = done charging).  The light would be out in the morning, but if I unplugged the charger for 1 minute and then reconnected it, it would take more of a charge.  It seems that they cut corners in fully impending USB C and in their charging logic.The power button is located on the bottom and 4 presses will cycle you thru low, medium, high, off.  The button reacts well and it is simple to operate.  With it being on the bottom however, I found my collar bone bumping the button and increasing the fan speed.  Not often enough to be a real problem, but a future design should absolutely move the button someplace that won‚??t get bumped so easily.My use case is, as a larger guy, I tend to sweat sooner and more than the average person.  Many times, I‚??ve wished for a breeze to evaporate the moisture from my skin.  This neck fan grants that wish on demand.  My test was 5 days at Disneyland in the Southern California heat.

As a person who works in a job field that requires to look around components that are tightly packed, this  endoscope has been a life and time saver. Its compact storage and  quick connection to my phone are only a fraction of its great features. It is made with durable materials and the multiple attachment tips have come in handy. Let me not forget to mention the scopes on board light which provides better clarity in those not so bright spaces. Highly recommend for any DIY, or handy person.

It's a good little camera. Very good quality with closeup pictures, and the end of it is small enough to get into tight spaces (Though because of its length it can't turn corners very well)The software is pretty easy to use. The only confusing this is that the camera is actually a WiFi camera. It only uses the USB port on your phone for power. You can connect it to a power bank and it'll work just fine as well.The connection to my Pixel 7 Pro was stable and a good frame rate.  I've attached photos from the camera to the review here, as well as a video.The dimensions of the camera module itself are 8mm / 0.32 inches in diameter and 68.3mm / 7.7 inches long.  The flexible neck is stiff enough to push the camera through tough spots, and stays bent in whatever shape you make it into.This camera would be great for inspecting engines, gun barrels 9mm / .357 or larger, plumbing, or just about anything else it can fit into.

This gadget is an excellent tool to have in any persons bag of tools. It is incredibly easy to use with a very straight forward app design, along with multiple adapters to use for a variation of phone types. The light on the end is bright enough to lighten the darkest of spaces paired with flexibility to contort into the tightest of angles. I work in awkward spaces and hard to see places on the daily and this simple device makes my job that much easier. Work smarter not harder use this product.

I got this so I could find and route wires that haven't been routed appropriately on charter buses but I'm having so much fun playing with this thing at home. I love it!I was a bit worried it didn't work with my phone though as the instructions say to open my non-existent WLAN settings BUT I found that after plugging it into my phone, I could access it as if it were a WiFi connection, connect to it, using the ANESOK-XXXX name given in the instructions manual, then restart the Anesok app. If the app is already running before plugging it in, it will show connected as wifi but won't connect in the app, make sure the app is completely closed (make sure it's not running in the background) before plugging it in, then it should work fine.

I've only had the charger for about 2 weeks after buying on a lightning deal.  As others have mentioned, it doesn't come with a charging block & it is noted to be 15W, not 20W, I was prepared for both.  That said, I anticipated it being a bit slower charging for my Galaxy S23 Ultra than the fast charge Samsung stand up model it was replacing that took a crash after 7 years.  So far, it has been working well, it does take about 2 hours for my phone to go from almost on life support to 100%, but I like that it is propped up, the green light indicator is on the side to not disturb me, and I can still easily use the phone while charging, if desired, with the lip holding tit in place either upright or sideways.  The entire unit stays cool while in use. So far, so good.  We'll see how it goes.  I have a back up ""rapid charging"" cable & block when this just won't cut it, but I prefer wireless at the end of the day and for most frequent needs.

I ordered two of these for my wife and I's S24's. The setup is literally plugging the cord it comes into, into the charger, and then plugging that cord into a wall adapter you provide. Quick and easy.They work really well. It isn't as fast as a good wall charger; my Samsung charger can take my S24 from close dead to 100% in around an hour; this charger takes about three hours. Either way, great for bed time, you just drop it on the charger and move on.The lights are completely unobtrusive, and I need a dark, dark space to sleep.The only downside I've found to it is that some thicker cases won't allow charging through them, but the slim cases work fine.

Phone sits in stand and charges without any problems. Two things you need to know:  this comes with a cord (c-cord I think) that's about 18 inches long. Not very long. And it doesn't come with a charger, but since you probably already have a plug in charger this would not be a problem. I needed a multiplug to reach an outlet in the bedroom. So far the system is working fine.

Works great! Fast charges my s22 ultra  and S24 just fine. Just make sure the plug and cable you are using can do fast charging.  If you use a USB type a it won't fast charge.  Which you wold think people would know by now but nope... lol works great!

I had one close to this from my youngest son who gave it to me since I used it everyday while visiting at his home with his new wife to be. I just loved using it and he gifted to me.  Unfortunately, it fell from the shelf where it sat one day and no longer worked and I was heartbroken though I never told him. I decided I needed to finally replace it.  I ordered a different one but it didn't work for me so this was a replacement and works fabulous. I truly love love love it. Sits on my counter and cannot fall again. Yippee. Charges great!!!

I bought this for my desk at work. It works really well and I'm happy with it. It is easy to sit my phone on, and I can even press things on the phone to an extent, without it moving. It's only an occasional issue where it slides back and it's when it's accumulated dirt/dust on the rubber feet. I swipe my finger across it and it stops sliding for a while.The only negative is the length of the cord. It's only a couple of feet. Not long enough to reach the tower under my desk. I guess if you have a monitor with a USB port, you can do that. I just ordered a 6', quality USB-A/USB-C cable and replaced it. No other issues. Charges my iPhone 8 Plus fast.

Bought this to leave on my desk at work because of its small footprint. It looks nice well made for the price but will not charge my samsung galaxy S22 ultra with the otterbox case intermittently. You will set the phone down and randomly sometime a few seconds or sometimes a few minutes it will stop charging and the led will flash indicating an obstruction telling the charger to stop charging. Removing and reinstalling the phone maybe 1 or 2 times will correct the issue and the phone will begin to charge but slowly, at the speed of about 20% to 80% in about 3.5 hrs.

My husband always seems to have problems with phone ports. He would have to fight with his phone cord to get it just right to charge his phone, and then heaven forbid you bump it! He is loving how easy it is to set his phone on this device without all the struggles he previously endured. As some reviewers have mentioned, it is not going to break speed records for charging your phone, but what it lacks in speed, it more than makes up for in ease of use. We are very pleased with this purchase.

I bought this to 'ring' my kids rooms and get their attention. Picture this: each fob is attached to a carabineer and placed in a bedroom closet or basement. Parents need something from one of them, press the corresponding button and the kid knows they are needed. It's amazing. Not too loud, works in upstairs bedrooms and basement. Remote stays in the kitchen. I chose this instead of a doorbell or intercom or yelling or banging on walls. It works perfectly! A room pager, a kid finder. So easy to use and install batteries.

Just received the 'Reyke Key Finder, 80dB RF Item Locator Tags'.  I will be using these to help my dog find  her ball, which to her is life itself.  I tried a GPS tag, but, it was too low in volume and finally the app failed well trying to find the lost tag!!  I don't know how well it will stand up to the rigger of ball strikes and dog spit.  To hedge my bet, I have enclosed it in Heat Shrink tubing and suspended with-in the ball with ty-raps.  The ball by the way is a open ball called 'Air Fetch Ball' by Chuckit. I have been using the finder already and I needed it twice.  Since it comes with four tags, I will have spares for when I have to 'send in another Timmy'.  The Range and loudness seems adequate for my needs.  So far I am happy with my purchase.

I use these to call my kid when he is playing at the park or gym. I just put one on a key ring and told him to come find me when I make it beep. It works at least 100 ft in a large, dense jungle gym which is pretty impressive because it seems they should cause pretty bad interference with a signal like this. On top of that, he loves it! I no longer have to yell for him, and he is always excited when he hears the beep and runs back to the table as fast as he can.With how I've seen this work for my kid, I know they would work just fine for a remote or keys if they are just lost in your house.

Whoever designed this collection of useful tools deserves an award. It's compact, labeled well, and simple to use.

The keyboard button remover does not fit any keyboard I have. And the little metal pointed tip has a ball at the end of it making it pretty useless to get into small cracks.  That being said, I love all the other brush attachments and screen cleaners!

I have used this for cleaning around all bathroom fixtures including the seat attachment points on the toilet. It is extremely durable and fits in the most difficult to reach areas with ease. I recommend this item for any cleaning needs that are in a tough to reach area or very narrow spots. the bristles hold up well and seem to revert to original even after vigorous scrubbing.

I have a glass shower, and there are some hard-to-get spots on the door, the brush is thin but strong enough to get the grime off, and it has worked perfectly in tight areas, that are difficult to clean.  Works as advertised, I gave a few to friends to try out as well.

I have been looking for tools that will help me clean small cracks in my window seals and in other kitchen items that have a very thin line that gathers dust. This product answered a desire I had for tools to take care of this problem. I use it on the rails of my sliding glass door and all my windows. The additional tools provided with this product are useful in cleaning too on window blinds and other things in the house.

I really like these brushes. While I won‚??t be using them on scratchable surfaces (they just seem too harsh) but they are perfect for cleaning out the vacuum filters and other small, thin unreachable areas around the house and out in the garage.

I love these KitchenAid shears! They're sharp, sturdy, and comfortable to hold ‚?? perfect for everything from snipping herbs to tackling chicken bones. But the best part? They come with a protective sheath.You see, my kids have a habit of ""borrowing"" my kitchen scissors for craft projects and who-knows-what-else, only to have them vanish into the abyss of their rooms. But thanks to this handy sheath, I can finally keep track of my shears! They're always where I left them, ready for kitchen duty.Plus, they're dishwasher safe, so even if the kids do manage to swipe them, at least I know they'll come back clean.If you're looking for a reliable, versatile pair of kitchen shears that can withstand both culinary tasks and the occasional kid-induced disappearance, look no further than KitchenAid.

KitchenAid usually doesn‚??t disappoint. These scissors are on the larger side, but the grip is very comfortable and easy to cut with. Cutting is smooth and sharp. I also like that it has multiple colors to choose from. I like the black since it doesn‚??t look out of place anywhere.

Very sharp and nice shears!! I have many many KitchenAid products in my home and it is a phenomenal brand that never disappoints! I was quick to buy these because I knew the quality would be amazing and at the low price, you can‚??t go wrong! They are extremely easy to clean and I use these for my hobby of 3D printing which is why I needed shears rather than regular scissors. The cutting is incredibly accurate every time even as a lefty! I love the fact that it has a sheath to avoid any accidents. I have two young kids and having everything sharp covered gives me peace of mind. I have had many shears in my time but I really like these because of the comfort grip and it came with a free sheath. Can‚??t go wrong with these, they are great! Highly recommend!!

I was standing right there when my son-in-law was trying to cut through something super tough with our kitchen scissors and the handle broke. My wife, who tends to get sentimental about odd things, complained that she had owned those for more than twenty years and had grown somewhat attached to them. I knew I would have to replace them with a nice pair it I was going to keep her happy, so I knew I was in good hands when I saw the ""Kitchen Aid"" label. Sure enough, they are razor sharp and look tough enough to last another twenty years.

Great price for a very helpful tool. Sometimes takes a couple of tries to get it to fully heat up and seal. It‚??s super fast and only takes seconds more than using a bag clip. Great quality, doesn‚??t get to hot, keeps everything fresh like new. Also works as a box opener with the blade that pops out. Has a magnet on the back to keep on the fridge but is very portable.

Amazing little gadget. One of the things I love about this product is its compact size. It is small and lightweight, making it easy to store and carry around. It is also very simple to use. All you have to do is press the sealing arm down on the bag and run it along the length of the bag. The heat from the sealing arm will melt the plastic, creating an airtight seal that will keep your food fresh for days.Another great feature of this product is its built-in cutter. It makes opening bags and sealing them back up a breeze. The magnet on the back of the sealer is also a nice touch. It allows you to keep the sealer close at hand on your fridge or other metal surfaces.I also appreciate that this product comes with two AA batteries included, so it is ready to use right out of the box. And since it uses batteries, you don't have to worry about finding an outlet or dealing with cords and wires.Overall, I highly recommend the mini bag sealer. It is a convenient and effective tool for keeping your snacks and other food items fresh. Its compact size, easy-to-use design, built-in cutter, and magnet make it a must-have for any home or office.

Plastic bags are made from many different polymers and it works pretty well on some, not so good on others. And it's very slow to properly seal a bag. A typical family size potato chip bag might take 2 x 15 second passes. AND STAY AWAY FROM THE EMBEDDED KNIFE. It's very, very sharp but awkward to use so keep it away from your fingers. USE IT AND YOU'LL CUT YOURSELF. I used it 3 times and cut myself twice.
"

This is a great, inexpensive way to keep things fresh. It works every time. If it starts to seal the bags poorly,  that's the time to change the batteries. Seals everything from chip bags to frozen fish in the bags. I highly recommend it.

This sealer was actually brought to my attention by an article I read on kitchen gadgets.  I checked it out on Amazon and after reading the product description I thought this cannot work as well as described in the article and on the Amazon Product Description but it was less than $10.00 so I thought I would give it a shot, knowing I could return it for a full refund.  As soon it arrived, I read the instructions and went to my pantry where I had several open chip bags.  I followed the instructions and it sealed the bags perfectly first time out.  I had a little problem knowing when to move it across the bag, but I learned it was pretty much instantaneously. As soon as you press it in on the device start sliding it across the bag. The actual sliding is a little more challenging but doable. The one thing I hope they improve is the shield between the two sealer edges that must be down for storage. Hopefully they can design it to be automatic instead of manual. This shield prevents the two hot (??) sealer edges from coming in contact (and heating up)  during storage.

This works as advertised. It does feel a little cheap in your hand, but I was actually surprised it performs as good as it does. Sure, it may not have all the cool features of one of the 'Best Buy' models, but this definitely does the job. The motor in it is pretty strong and it feels very nice on my back and arms where I mostly use it.The variety of attachments is pretty nice, but I only use maybe 2 of them. The pamphlet it comes with it informative on how to relieve pain in certain areas. I haven't quite utilized that yet as I just use it where it's hurting, but maybe I'll try it out.It charges quickly using USB-C and the battery lasts quite awhile with the use we've been giving it. I used it maybe twice a day for a few minutes each time for a week, and it only dropped to 60%. Seems like plenty for my usage at the moment.The case is nice. You can't fit it into the case with any of the attachments on. You'll have to take it off to store it. But it's not difficult to attach anything. It seems like the tip screws on/off to attach or maybe add pressure to keep the attachment on the massage gun, but it doesn't seem to loosen or tighten the attachment, so I'm not sure if that's the intended use or not. Taking it off doesn't change anything, so maybe I'm just misunderstanding what it's actual function is.Anyway, I'm happy with this budget friendly option for a massage gun. It really does feel very nice on my sore areas and muscles.

I use this daily in many different sizes of jars. It works really well and helps get everything out of the jars. It‚??s both flexible and hard enough for even thicker things like peanut butter. As an added bonus it‚??s really cute and fun to use. I love it!

This little tool works well in helping to stir my natural peanut butter. Even though it helps with the cuteness of this product, the indentations of the nostrils makes it harder to clean.

First saw this product in a YouTube video. How have I managed to get by without it? Best spreader. Good size. Child friendly. Very flexible. Sturdy. I use it all the time. From making pb&j for everyone or using it to help remove muffins and cupcakes from hot pans. Splatypus works every single time.

Well packaged for gifting, this spreader is the perfect gift for a cat lover.  The handle is firm while the ‚??blade‚?ù has enough flexibility to remove a product from its jar.  Sadly it is a little too short to use on American jars for mayonnaise a such.While cute and useful, it‚??s sadly overpriced.

the salt shaker stopped working, we changed the batteries, still not working. I've tried to contact customer service, but no luck. I've been using this for maybe 2 months, maybe once or twice a day when I cook. Should not have stopped working. Sad part is there's no one to help you but a computer customer service.

### Review of Gravity Electric Salt and Pepper MillsI recently purchased the Gravity Electric Salt and Pepper Mills, and they have completely transformed my cooking and dining experience. From the sleek design to the effortless functionality, these mills are a must-have for any kitchen.**Design and Build Quality**The first thing that caught my eye was the modern and elegant design of these mills. They are crafted with high-quality stainless steel and clear acrylic, which not only looks great on the dining table but also ensures durability. The clear window allows you to easily see how much salt or pepper is left, which is a convenient feature.**Ease of Use**What sets these mills apart is the gravity operation. Simply tilt the mill, and it automatically starts grinding. There's no need to press any buttons or twist any knobs, making it incredibly easy to use, especially when you have your hands full while cooking. The adjustable coarseness setting is another fantastic feature, allowing you to choose between fine and coarse grinds to suit your taste.**Performance**The performance of these mills is outstanding. The ceramic grinding mechanism is efficient and provides a consistent grind every time. Whether you're seasoning a delicate dish or adding a robust flavor to a hearty meal, these mills deliver just the right amount of salt or pepper with precision.**Battery Life**The mills are powered by batteries, which last a long time even with frequent use. Changing the batteries is straightforward, and the mills come with a clear instruction manual that makes the setup process a breeze.**Overall Experience**Overall, I am extremely satisfied with my purchase of the Gravity Electric Salt and Pepper Mills. They combine style, functionality, and ease of use in a way that enhances both cooking and dining. I highly recommend these mills to anyone looking for a reliable and elegant solution for their seasoning needs. They make a great gift too!In conclusion, the Gravity Electric Salt and Pepper Mills are a fantastic addition to any kitchen. Their user-friendly design, consistent performance, and aesthetic appeal make them a standout product that I would gladly purchase again.

I saw these and debated it because I have a couple of nice spoon rests that I've used for years... but when I was making a large family meal and had multiple spoons and a fork on the stove, there just wasn't enough room and some of the utensils were hot and sauce dripped on the stove occasionally.  Well that day I went to my ""wish list"" and I bought one! I wondered why I waited so long! I use mine daily and it's better than any spoon holder I have EVER had or used.  The spoon holder is pretty but awkward and  sometimes gets in the way when I have a stove top full of cookware! These may not be decorated and pretty as one of my spoon holders but oh my gosh, I use them WAY more often and they clean up so much easier. I can sit it on the stove even when the oven is hot, no problem. I would never put it on or near a hot burner as I'm sure it could be damaged from direct heat...I can put several spoons and a fork on it and still have room.  I especially like that the utensils can be set in the grooves on an angle and any sauce that might drip off doesn't make a mess... just wash with dishes and back on the stove it goes.  I have used it for knives, serving forks, spoons, serving ladles.. and my spoon rest never did that!  It's flexible and durable, not flimsy at all.  They come in a LOT of different colors too!  The price is reasonable, it's well made and the seller shipped it to me very quickly or Amazon had them in stock at a local distribution center.. I got it in a day or so!  I have told family and friends about it. Even a friend who doesn't really cook,  asked ""What's this?"" and said oh she would actually use one.  This would also be a nice housewarming gift for a new cook or someone just getting started, maybe in a gift basket with some hand towels and hot pads!  I'm sure it would be appreciated too!

I recently added the Silicone Utensil Rest with Drip Pad to my kitchen arsenal, and I couldn't be happier with my purchase.

Its silicone construction ensures durability and easy cleaning, making it a breeze to maintain even during the busiest of cooking sessions. The multiple slots allow me to neatly organize multiple utensils at once, keeping my countertop tidy and my utensils easily accessible. This handy accessory has quickly become an essential part of cooking routine.Affordability was also a major factor in my decision to purchase this utensil rest, and it certainly didn't disappoint in this regard. Despite its high-quality construction and functionality, it comes at a price that won't break the bank, making it accessible to all.What's more, the sleek design of this utensil rest seamlessly integrates into my kitchen color scheme and decor. Its neutral tones complement any style, adding a touch of minimalistic sophistication to my culinary space.Overall, I highly recommend this Silicone Drip Pad to anyone in need of a practical and affordable solution for a mess-free cooking experience. It's a game-changer that has earned its place as a staple in my kitchen.

My Nike Air Force One fits me perfectly in size 11 1/2. The one foot is a bit larger than the other. When I bought these in 11 1/2, they were extremely tight. I moved onto 12, and still, my toe touched the tip. I finally ordered 12 1/2 just to give it a shot, and voil√† they fit perfectly.Not sure what's up with Nike when sizing these shoes/sneakers, but someone takes a look at what's going on in the factory where these are made. When you get past the sizing, the shoe fits great, it has a nice bounce in the ball of the foot and is very comfortable. Good luck finding the right size. Do yourself a favor and order at least 1/2 size larger. I know it sounds odd to say order a size larger that might be what it takes. It was for me. I do highly recommend these though when you find the right fit.

I‚??ve used versions of this shoe since 1982, while still a young buck.  These are the most comfortable, yet.  My 4-stars is because I don‚??t believe the lace loops will hold up with tight tension, as previous ones have broke. But, Amazon also sells brass eyelet kits that if you think there‚??s enough value left in the shoe, you can repair it.  I also add Spenco inserts, removing the OEM ones.  Also, my first recent shoes a couple weeks ago came only in a bag! This is my backup pair.  I always repurpose the nice boxes, like shown. For the thousands of you with an 8"" pet Amazon‚?¶..the jungle River, tarantula , these make good carriers when showing off your pet in public.

My Nike Air Force One fits me perfectly in size 11 1/2. The one foot is a bit larger than the other. When I bought these in 11 1/2, they were extremely tight. I moved onto 12, and still, my toe touched the tip. I finally ordered 12 1/2 just to give it a shot, and voil√† they fit perfectly.Not sure what's up with Nike when sizing these shoes/sneakers, but someone takes a look at what's going on in the factory where these are made. When you get past the sizing, the shoe fits great, it has a nice bounce in the ball of the foot and is very comfortable. Good luck finding the right size. Do yourself a favor and order at least 1/2 size larger. I know it sounds odd to say order a size larger that might be what it takes. It was for me. I do highly recommend these though when you find the right fit.

Shoes arrived a day early, and in perfect condition. The top of the original box was missing, but that box was packaged inside a bigger, sturdier cardboard box for shipping, and it did its job in keeping the shoes from being compromised in any way. I noticed a whole horde of comments are condemning the seller for sending a slightly damaged original box and I find this SO ridiculous. Those orange Nike logo boxes are flimsy from the start, and aren‚??t made for shipping - only for in-store handling.  This is a great product from a reputable seller - give these a try!

Shoe came with tons of paint specs on the rubber bottom.  There's black, red, blue specs covering the rubber bottom of the shoe.  ""Leather"" portion of the the shoe looks amazing, except for some stitching that is frayed (easily fixed with careful use of a bic lighter).  This leads me to believe the seller I chose is sending out rejected factory shoes they got their hands on that did not meet standards or perhaps shoes that were returned that had been previously worn by a pastel art painter (lol).  Not sure if I will return and repurchase do to time and hassle, going to try and figure out how to remove paint from rubber effectively (because other than that and the frayed stitching which can be easily fixed) these shoes are actually very hard to come by in specific sizings unless you want to buy from Ebay or small online retailers in Europe.Edit:  They were actually a different model of Nike that I received.  They were DH3160s and not CQ9246s.SELLER:  JMEGoods

All the running snobs hate on Nike running shoes, but I have run thousands of miles in Nike Pegs and they have always been my favorite shoe. I have run in asics, brooks, new balance, saucony, and I keep coming back to this shoe.It's got a soft heel that is good for heel strikers like me (meaning when your front foot hits the ground it actually hits on the heel, not the middle of the foot. If you're a mid foot striker this isnt' the shoe for you.

I am in my early 60's and run 3 miles every other day of the week.  At 220 lbs it has become more of a challenge to get through a run comfortably the last few years.  The cushion in these shoes is great.  I also developed bunions in the back of my heel in the military wearing garrison shoes and other running shoes would only last 100 miles or so before the padding in the back of the shoe had a hole worn into them and started giving me blisters.  Nike shoes have a design that has never worn out for me and I transition them to my every day walking shoes when I get a new pair of runners.  I have been wearing Nike Running shoes for that reason since 2005.  Color doesn't matter, I usually buy this model at the lowest price I can find but it seems they come in every color of the rainbow which would appeal to most folks.

To me, this is the one of the nicest looking running shoes out there right now. White is a great shoe color and most running shoes look ugly in my opinion.I was concerned coming into this with how dirty it would look due to dirt, but it's actually very manageable. Simply throw it in the washing machine with some Oxyclean, air dry, and it looks nearly brand new. If excessively soiled, soak in Oxyclean overnight and then wash.The fit is true to size but slightly snug as you break it in. The entire front of the shoe is like a soft mesh so it's very comfortable, but that also means if you kick anything it'll hurt, trust me. The cushion is pretty good- an upgrade over non running shoes but not excessive like Hoka's. I can walk for about one and a half hours before my feet actually start hurting.Overall, would recommend. Definitely is kinda pricey but it's hard to find good looking running shoes so it's an L I was willing to take.

Was looking for the previous model of Pegasus Air Zoom because it's one of very few running shoes that fit with insoles but I couldn't find it anymore. However this Pegasus model fits also fantastic. It may sound bit strange, but finding sport shoes with the possibility to fit insoles is a real challenge. Not anymore.

I don't know how these shoes aren't rated a lot lower they are very cheaply made the material is very thin and feels like it can easily detach from the white part. The insole of the shoe is just like plastic and just feels uncomfortable. The sole itself is very hard and just feels like cheap plastic. Walking around in them feels horrible because it just feels like walking on hard plastic.  They were also very narrow at least for me. I know some people will say what do you expect for $60 but these shoes should honestly be $30 or less than that.

The Nike Air Max 2017 Men's Running Shoes are a great option for people looking for comfortable and stylish shoes. The shoes feature a sleek and modern design, with a breathable mesh upper that allows for maximum airflow and keeps feet cool and dry. While it's coined a ""running shoe"", I don't think this would be a great shoe for serious runners. To me, it's better labeled a ""casual shoe"". Two reasons for this:¬∑ It's actually a pretty heavy shoe.¬∑ The rebound isn't all that responsive.For a casual shoe, one of the standout features of these shoes is the Air Max cushioning system, which provides shock absorption and support. We've owned previous versions of this same shoe without the shock absorption- there's a big difference. The cushioning is good for long walks, providing the necessary support and comfort.The outsole of the Air Max 2017 is made of durable rubber for traction and durability. The outsole also features a waffle pattern that helps to grip the ground, making it comfortable to walk on a variety of surfaces. The outsole also features a flex groove design which allows for a natural range of motion and a more efficient stride.The fit of the shoe is true to size. The shoes also have a padded collar and tongue for added comfort and support. My son has worn the shoes for three days. While he is happy with the overall fit, the toe box may be a little shallow which has caused him to trip a few times. I am sure this will improve with time.Overall, these Nike shoes are a good option for a casual shoe that provides a comfortable, supportive, and stylish shoe. I only rated the shoes as four stars because Nike continues to call this a running shoe when it's actually a casual shoe. Hopefully, Nike will eventually separate casual athletic shoes from true running shoes.

I got these as a gift for my husband and was super happy with how they looked. He also loved them until we noticed there were two left shoes. Did not see an option to exchange the shoes so I had to chat with Amazon support. They told me they would get a replacement ordered, but just about a week later I got an email that they couldn't reach the seller and I would just have to return them. I ended up having to pay to ship them back so just a waste of time and money. Super disappointed they wouldn't just send a replacement.

Was a little nervous at first ordering shoes online regarding size and fit, but after receiving and re-lacing these , they fit perfectly. I've always wanted this color combo, so pretty psyched. Glad I went with my gut and ordered my size.  Much gratitude to the seller and sending these so quickly.

These are noticeably more stable than my normal running shoes during weight lifting. They are especially nice for squats, lunges, deadlifts, or standing and pressing weight overhead.

I recently purchased a pair of Men's Nike shoes for my son, and I am thrilled to share my positive experience with this product. These shoes have truly exceeded our expectations, providing both a perfect fit and noticeable improvements in his running abilities.First and foremost, the fit of these Nike shoes is exceptional. They have been designed with precision, ensuring a comfortable and secure fit for my son's feet. The shoes hug his feet perfectly, providing the necessary support and stability for his active lifestyle. He has expressed his satisfaction with how well they fit, allowing him to move freely and confidently during his runs and other physical activities.In terms of performance, these Nike shoes have made a noticeable difference. My son has experienced enhanced running capabilities since wearing them. The shoes offer excellent cushioning and support, enabling him to run with greater ease and agility. He has expressed that his feet feel lighter, and he can maintain better traction and grip while on the move. These shoes have truly helped him elevate his running game.The quality of these Nike shoes is outstanding. The materials used are durable and built to last, with no signs of wear or tear even after regular use. The shoes have proven to be resilient and capable of withstanding the demands of my son's active lifestyle. I am confident that they will continue to provide long-lasting performance, making them a worthwhile investment.Overall, I am extremely pleased with the Men's Nike shoes I purchased for my son. Not only do they fit him perfectly, but they have also significantly improved his running abilities. The exceptional quality and durability of these shoes ensure that they will accompany him on his adventures for a long time to come. I highly recommend these Nike shoes to anyone seeking reliable, performance-enhancing footwear.

Comfortable and good looking. I had to speed walk about 5 1/2 miles only a couple days after getting the shoes. My feet felt fine afterwards and I had stability during my walk.

The first day I wore these, I went for a walk, and upon my walk was a nice big pile of dog doo doo. I was unaware of this big pile of doo-doo until it was too late. As I flew ybackward, I recall looking up at the sky, and to my surprise, I saw one of my brand new shoes flying by.  Next thing I knew I was lying there on the cold, hard sidewalk in such shock I layed there for what felt like forever. I slowly began to rise to my feet. I started to check myself for any injuries when suddenly I got a whiff of a nostril-burning foul smell. I reached my hand around to my back only to bring it right back abruptly.  I let out a loud scream followed by a gagging reaction to the dog poop that was now on my hand.  I ran to the grass and dropped to my knees I frantically began wiping my hand on the grass. As a tear ran down my face I remembered thinking can this day get any worse? Well, guess what it did! Behind me was a loud bark that scared me so much I jumped forward. I was now lying on the ground once more. As I got to my knees, I stood up quickly, eager to see the culprit that I believed to be the doggy doo doo bandit, but as I turned around to confront this demon, I promptly began to plead because in this dogs mouth was my other shoe I slowly began to approach this dog as I got close enough I made a daring move I tried to jump on the dog. I was unsuccessful with dog poop on my back, and with only one shoe on, I began to walk home sad and smelly.  Anyway I hope this helps your decision to buy these shoes or not

I bought a pair of these shoes because I needed a comfortable pair of black shoes for work. They were great for a few days and then started to squeak with every step. I figured it would go away after they get broken in, but it got worse. When I was in FL i stepped off my boat and sank knee deep in mud and lost my shoes, so I ordered another pair, because they are comfortable and affordable. They feel good while working in the office, and they feel good for walking or running on the track. But wouldn't you know it? The second pair also squeaks. If you intend to use these for walking on grass or dirt, I definitely recommend these shoes, but be ware of the dreaded squeak....

I am a woman who owns Nike Tanjun sneakers in various colors, so I ordered these for my son.  He agrees that these are the best feeling sneakers he has ever worn!  He has been wearing them for months, and they still look & feel like new.  They are totally fashionable, but most of all, they offer extreme comfort that you just can't find in other sneakers.  The fit is true to size,  but most MEN can go up 1/2 size for the best comfort you've ever felt.  The Fashion & Comfort factors are 100 stars!!!  (And btw, my 90 year old dad also LOVES wearing Nike Tanjuns, and his 73 yr old wife too!  Proof that these are not just for 18 yr olds! :)  Best to wait & get them when the price is equal or lower than shopping at DSW or other online shoe stores.  Enjoy!

I just finished darning a hole that developed in the fabric of these shoes.  Really surprised and disappointed that I had to do that, especially since these shoes are less than a year old.  If this had been a cheap generic shoe from Walmart I would have expected as much but I paid up for a pair of Nikes with great reviews assuming they would outlast my previous pair of running shoes.  By the way that pair of previous shoes were a cheap generic pair from Target that lasted a few years. Comfort level was okay but not as amazing as I would have liked.  I spend most of my days standing / walking, so I was hoping for something that would leave my feet feeling good at the end of the day.  As it stands my feet usually hurt by days end, though admittedly feel better than when I wore the cheap Target shoes. Visually these look good and are well ventilated as you would expect.  They dry nicely when they happen to get wet.Overall I am ranking them at a 2 out of 5 simple because I paid over 70 dollars and had to patch a hole in the toe box and it‚??s not even been a year, for only a moderately more comfortable shoe.  Hopefully this is the only hole that I‚??ll be seeing and can get a bit more life out of these things before I have to invest in another daily walker.Update: 11/15/2021.  Changed my review of these shoes to 1 star.  It's been several months since my last review.  The toe box of this shoe is wearing out in multiple places.  Has been for awhile but I've put off looking for a new pair just because I expected more out of a pair of Nikes and wanted to get at least 1 year out of these.  They did manage to not completely fall apart before 1 year was over.  Take my review for what it's worth since it's in the minority but I guess the construction on these are hit and miss, as some people seem to report the issue I have while many others rave about them.  Good luck if you get them.

My wife has been begging (bugging) me for Nike ‚??dunks‚?ù but I couldn‚??t afford to pay over $120-$150 so I was over the moon when I found these very dunk-like Nikes for her and she was equally pleased. Nike may run larger; I had to return them at first for a smaller size so you might want to order them 1/2 size smaller than you normally would. They‚??re still very trendy and comfortable. The pink color is feminine and playful yet they aren‚??t garish and can be paired with earth tones or loud colors. I highly recommend!

The pink color is feminine and playful yet they aren‚??t garish and can be paired with earth tones or loud colors. I highly recommend!

Haven‚??t worn em yet, probably won‚??t for a while til a special ocassion or a date‚?¶maybe my vacation in August‚?¶BUT these are PURE FIRE and for tha price, I could NOT pass.  Need to cop me some display cases for my next few finds like this. Don‚??t regret it! If these is ur color, snag em before it‚??s too late. They also fit much better than other shoes in my size: not tight at all, but firm like a glove for once.

I am a teenager who is now making my own money, so I now buy my own things. I personally have grown a bit stingy with my money and am not always sure what to buy. I thought making a review would help some others like myself.1: I have easily irritable skin (I always somehow see an allergic reaction to the skin products I usually use/get.) ‚?? and I get acne from the sports I do. These products do not make my skin burn or anything of the sort, as well as my acne goes away quickly after using this (-But I do not have severe acne, a few bumps and pimples here and there, mostly on the forehead.) It‚??s always an easy application, my skin is soft afterwards, and at most my skin gets a little pink after putting it on but instantly goes back away.2: What I have seen in my products I have received- they don‚??t fill the container/containers up fully. I have seen this mostly in the face cream. It doesn‚??t bother me too much, but it is a bit unsatisfactory knowing I could have had more product and I know that would turn some other people off.3: From other reviews I have read, some people are complaining about the smell of a product/the products. The smell they are probably talking about is the smell of the daily cleanser. (I have not smelled anything badly from any of the other products) - The smell of the daily cleanser smells like a soapy / dish soap kind of smell. The smell really goes away fast for me and doesn‚??t bother me so much, but I do understand how it could turn some other people off.4: The size of the products aren‚??t very surprising to me. It‚??s big enough for testers - (as seen in photos). It gives you a good taste of what the products have in store for you. I‚??ve had these products for about a week now and I have been liking them for the price. (They are not gone in a week as long as you use the right amount of product according to the instructions on the back of the bottle/containers.)5: The product I REALLY like from this set alone is the makeup melting cleansing balm. As seen on the instructions on the back of the container, this is used for dry skin. (I personally get dry skin around my mouth and on the top of my nose bridge- above my mouth, beside my mouth, etc.) this helped A LOT. Not even exaggerating, I swear! The product didn‚??t make my skin feel stiff or burn after using.

My mom and I both have dry skin. She has some full size products which I used and wanted to try a wider range. I love how these products feel. Many moisturizers I've tried left my face feeling heavy. I agree that the products are a bit smaller than pictured, however, a very small amount goes a long way. I am always frugal about my skin care usage, so I tried about a pencil -sized amount and it was enough for me.

or perfect for samples. I ordered for the moisturizer and though I would order this entire sample/travel set to give it a try. I've been using this for a few weeks now as a primary face cleanser set and I love it. The under eye cream and serum do a great job for overnight repair. The moisturizer helps my dry skin so much and leaves it soft each time. The makeup remove balm IS AMAZING. I'm definitely buying this as a full product. The face wash is gentle and smells heavenly. The entire set is great. It has helped with my dry skin and this Arizona summer ""dry heat""

I was very surprised by the quality of these products.  The smell was pleasant, not overly fragrant.  I have sensitive skin and this did not flare up my skin.  No burning sensation with my sensitive skin.  I have very dry skin and this helped it.  Made my skin feel soft.  Helped with the dryness.  Didnt leave my skin itchy.  Ive used all the products and all seemed good to me.  The cleanser, I used with a silicone face brush.  Good lather.  Cleans makeup and daily diet well.  It doesn't leave your skin oily.  All products absorb well into the skin.  I didn't break out  using these products.  Very impressive.  Will buy again.

It arrived today and I couldn‚??t wait to use it! I followed step by step instructions that are on the back of the packaging. And immediately wanted to give this product 5 stars! 5 easy to follow instructions and BAM my face feels amazing!!! I will be purchasing the full size set! Elf is an awesome product try it I‚??m sure you will love it like I do!!!!

I love this product. Glad I purchased the mini-set because I would never have tried all the products, since I have sensitive skin and don't like wasting money. I plan to buy the full size products as I run out.The moisturizer is great, no skin reaction and works well on my dry and normal skin.The oil really feels like it penetrates deeply. I use it on my dry eczema spots mainly and I don't feel so scaly there anymore.The face wash works great. My skin always feels smooth afterwards.I don't wear makeup often, but the few times I've used the makeup remover, it was different. It's more of a solid/wax type texture, but it definitely removed my eye makeup quickly and it felt better than the stuff with beads and my eyes were not red afterwards, which is rare for me.

I was very surprised by the quality of these products.  The smell was pleasant, not overly fragrant.  I have sensitive skin and this did not flare up my skin.  No burning sensation with my sensitive skin.  I have very dry skin and this helped it.  Made my skin feel soft.  Helped with the dryness.  Didnt leave my skin itchy.  Ive used all the products and all seemed good to me.  The cleanser, I used with a silicone face brush.  Good lather.  Cleans makeup and daily diet well.  It doesn't leave your skin oily.  All products absorb well into the skin.  I didn't break out  using these products.  Very impressive.  Will buy again.

I work for Amazon and saw this product while packing and said to myself ‚??I've been looking for a face care routine. Let me give this a shot!‚?ù On my break I ordered it! It arrived today and I couldn‚??t wait to use it! I followed step by step instructions that are on the back of the packaging. And immediately wanted to give this product 5 stars! 5 easy to follow instructions and BAM my face feels amazing!!! I will be purchasing the full size set! Elf is an awesome product try it I‚??m sure you will love it like I do!!!!

I love this product. Glad I purchased the mini-set because I would never have tried all the products, since I have sensitive skin and don't like wasting money. I plan to buy the full size products as I run out.The moisturizer is great, no skin reaction and works well on my dry and normal skin.The oil really feels like it penetrates deeply. I use it on my dry eczema spots mainly and I don't feel so scaly there anymore.The face wash works great. My skin always feels smooth afterwards.I don't wear makeup often, but the few times I've used the makeup remover, it was different. It's more of a solid/wax type texture, but it definitely removed my eye makeup quickly and it felt better than the stuff with beads and my eyes were not red afterwards, which is rare for me.

After reading some of the reviews that complained about the fragrance, I was a little reluctant try it. But I'm glad I did. This skin care feels so nice on my face. It isn't thick and globby. And my sensitive skin isn't reacting negatively.

I bought the watermelon spray because I like the brand and the watermelon dew drops. I did not like the smell of this spray (cheap bitter artificial watermelon) but the scent does not linger too long. I thought the effect on the skin was good but not 5 star good. I have the d‚??alba spray and the tatchaspray that I like much better. I‚??m not sorry I bought it and I use it but truthfully it comes in at 3rd place in my stash if facial mists.

I have loved this product ever since my friend got some in a subscription box of hers once that wasn‚??t a box that I was receiving; and she saw I loved it so much that she ran out the next day and got me my own. It was my fav gift EVER. I used it all last summer and took it with me everywhere I went for spritzes of refreshment and watermelon smell. Try keeping it in your fridge before going to the pool or wherever. It‚??s amazing. I loved it so much I was spritzing everyone, much the the dismay of several manly men, but to the joy of several others. (So there is PLENTY of product but I bought several because I like to share things I love.) When I went to buy yet another bottle recently I was so confused to see the watermelon dew drops that had gone viral because I had thought this was their only product prior to that and thought they just changed their formula and bottle or something since that other product kept on popping up when I typed this in. I was so distraught. Luckily I eventually found this beloved product obviously; but not before giving the few drops a try. I bought the sample box with it in it and the full sized bottle of it thinking it must be even more amazing since it went viral and this product didn‚??t. WRONG. There is nothing impressive about the few drops whatsoever. Should‚??ve known. Anyhow hashtag this is the real deal product of theirs that DESERVES to go viral. Buy this. You won‚??t tegret it. And if you do then something is wrong with you and not this amazing product!!! Smell is amazing, light shimmer is amazing, no stickiness, lots of refreshment, wear it with or without makeup, add a spritz of watermelon happiness to your day! I only recommend they do the exact same formula in different scents. ::hint, hint:: I love banana and you never see banana stuff. ;)

This came in and was exactly what I was looking for. My daughter has lots of makeup and skincare products, but not an abundance of storage space. This has allowed her to get all of her products neatly organized, and looks nice in her room. It was easy to assemble, it is very durable, spins easily and holds a lot of product.

When it comes to storage space for your brushes, the brush holder may seem small at first glance, but don't be fooled by its size - it can easily accommodate up to 30 brushes. However, it is worth noting that the brushes may sometimes slide out, which can be a bit inconvenient. On the bright side, the holder is made of plastic, making it incredibly easy to clean and maintain.One of the things that stands out about this makeup organizer is its clear acrylic material, which not only provides a sleek and modern look but also complements a minimalistic aesthetic. In terms of functionality, the holder does its job well and meets the needs of those looking to store their brushes in an organized manner.Putting this makeup organizer together is a breeze, thanks to the clear and simple instructions that come with it. The plastic material used is also quite durable, ensuring that it will last for a long time. Additionally, the lazy Susan feature of the holder allows for smooth and easy rotation, making it a convenient option for accessing your brushes easily.Overall, the makeup holder not only offers practical storage solutions but also adds a touch of style to your space. Its ease of use, durability, and sleek design make it a great choice for anyone looking to keep their brushes/makeup organized and easily accessible.

I'll be using this for life. It's perfect my skin. I ditched foundation a while ago because I didn't need it. My skin is clear but I still wanted something light so that my powder blush would set right. Something that was not tacky or greasy. This is it. I like the way it feels and it looks great. It wasn't dry or oily. The last product I tried in this category felt tacky and too shiny and it was 3x the price of this. It made my pores look huge. This actually minimized the appearance of my pores. Don't be fooled by the products that are more expensive. This was so reasonably priced and I'm very pleased.

I love this stuff so much. I will either mix it in with my moisturizer or foundation. It gives me that glowy tan look im looking for. Its kinda subtle so you will have to mix equal parts of whatever your using. I got the darkest shade for this reason. The other ones don‚??t show up as well as the darkest one. I know that the pale one is great if your actually pale and want to look glowy but the dark one is mostly just to achieve a tan look.

I've never been good at or got the hang of doing contour or even bronzer. I've been trying to find a slightly more glam version of my usual natural makeup look for my wedding, but I just suck at and hate the look of bronzer! But my face felt too flat and pale with my base of foundation. This solved my issue! It's the perfect balance of bringing warmth and a little shimmer to my face without the effort of shaping with a brush. It's smooth and easily sits on top of my skin tint or foundation and warms my face back up. A little bit of blush and I'm good to go!

I place this strategically after applying foundation and concealer. It gives a pretty glow, enough of a highlight without looking overdone. It‚??s a softer highlight than any of the powders I have and I like that. I tried it by itself without foundation and also mixed with foundation, but both ways caused breakouts on my ridiculously sensitive skin. I use L‚??Oreal Infallible foundation, which doesn‚??t cause me to break out, and hoped that being from the same cosmetic company, this product wouldn‚??t either.

This product provides moisture, a healthy glow and a hint of color without settling into lines and wrinkles or accentuating them.  It gives skin a youthful glow and just glides on.

I am still so amazed by this phenomenal product even months after I received it!! My use of the one word ""WOW"" is really all you need to know lol. I've tried sooooo many other products claiming to give you that ""dewy, glowy"" look without making you look greasy and oily...but sadly, they always did, and until I found this AMAZING product, I was only wasting more of my hard-earned money on more pricey products that promised the moon when all they ever delivered was grease/oil on my face! Yuck! So of course I was a bit skeptical about giving this product a chance, but I do overall like most e.l.f. products (yes, I admit I've used some pretty bad ones from them, but hopefully by now they've improved those previous low-quality products I had tried; I mean, haven't we all basically experienced disappointment with pretty much every mainstream beauty brand we try out? AT LEAST once, anyway)? Well, back to this product review. Thought I'd give it a try too because I've also always loved e.l.f.'s prices, and figured if I didn't like it, I could just return it anyway and it's not like I'd be out tons of money if for some reason I couldn't return it.  I think the e.l.f. brand has also became so much more successful and big not only to growing the selection of its products but also improving their quality. In addition, a huge part of their success (imo anyways) is that they've always stayed pretty true to their price range/category for their products (and that price category is wayyyyy more affordable for pretty much ANY woman - YAY FOR US AND YAY FOR E.L.F.)!! This product comes in a heavier glass bottle, so you have to be a bit careful not to drop and break it (duhhh I know but had to mention it)!  But it's also partially heavy not because of just the glass bottle but also because you get a decent amount of the actual product inside the bottle! I have tons of other similar products, most though are in fairly small tubes; sure, they can't break like glass bottles can but they also don't hold a nice amount of product like this one does. Granted, you don't need a ton of highlighter in general; one doesn't want to look like they just walked through some type of weird glitter factory (btw, absolutely NO GLITTER in this, not even a tiny trace of any, so yayyyy!) - but again, just emphasizing how much product you get for the price and what a great value it is compared to most others I've tried, which is a big deal to me (I'm not super rich lol, and affordable, amazing products are very hard to come by, as I think most of us can relate to). The very first time I used this product, I hadn't had much sleep the night before (I struggle with severe insomnia; I have for decades), and I admit I pretty much looked like a severely hung-over person would look lol. I splashed some cool water on my face (I was soooo exhausted!) and grabbed my new bottle of e.l.f.'s glowy ""magic-in-a-bottle"" (what I like to call it at times, ha!), and thought ""what the heck, I'll try it because I really can't look much worse than I do now!""  I had some hope but not a ton of it as I opened up that glass bottle. Then I began to use the larger doe foot applicator (it comes with the product) to apply a few various-sized dots on my face (about the sizes of nickels and dimes, etc.).  I thought the applicator was pretty easy to use and it smoothly applied a good, decent amount of product to my face. I  dotted the liquid onto my chin, cheeks, around/under my eyes (careful not to get too close to my eyes, common sense), a bit along the bridge of my nose, my forehead, and then my temple areas. Basically my entire face lol. Now mind you I skipped any kind of actual specific primers, moisturizers, etc. before applying this product as I really wanted to see exactly how it looked on my skin without anything but that on it! Normally I do apply moisturizer, primer, sunscreen, etc. (when I applied those on later before this product, it didn't change how wonderfully beautiful it still worked and looked on my face)!  I didn't wait too long to start carefully and gently rubbing the liquid into my skin before it could dry (if you like to take a bit more time applying, like I do sometimes, then I just apply the product one section of my face at a time and get the same great results). The liquid feels silky, a bit thin but not too much or watery, and blended in nicely just using my fingers (I really don't use spongey applicators to blend my face makeup, as I get too impatient and constantly have to wash them - they grow and spread bacteria way too much, too often, something I'd rather avoid altogether - so, usually I just use my fingers and wash my hands a lot right then and there of course).  Once everything was well blended and my skin had absorbed every last drop of the product, I could not, absolutely could NOT believe my eyes! Or my other senses! My face has never ""glowed"" or looked so naturally ""dewy"" EVER! I had FINALLY achieved the perfect glowy/dewy look I'd wanted for so long and waited forever for!  Note: keep in mind, a little of this stuff can go a long way depending on the look you are trying to achieve and/or how much liquid make-up products you prefer to apply onto your face). Surprisingly it actually did provide some actual, slight coverage on my face too (just enough to make my skin look flawless, which is perfect)! I'm actually still in shock lol. My identical twin sister, who never liked that ""dewy"" look, couldn't even resist it herself after seeing me wear it every day - she finally gave in and uses it all the time now - she absolutely loves it!  I also love the fact that you can wear it under your regular face makeup too, use it as a glowy primer, or, just only wear it with no other make-up products (like on those days when you just want a tiny bit of coverage and/or glow/dewyness, but don't feel like doing your entire makeup routine...because let's face it, ladies...there are just some days when the last thing we want to go through is our usual, sometimes pretty time-consuming makeup ""rituals"")!  On days like those (which are happening more and more as I get older, ugh!) I would much rather just apply a little bit of whatever, like this perfect glowy skin perfector, before running out the door to face the day! If you don't have a makeup routine? Cool! You can still quickly just dab this on your face, rub it in, and end up wherever you're going on time but this time you'll not only be on time, you'll also be an extremely, extra-glowing beauty! I'm serious, even if I had to be cheesy there :)  (yes, this product is THAT PHENOMENAL and I am NOT writing this review for ANYTHING in return; wanted to make that very clear). Also:My skin is combo, but mostly dry. It can get pretty oily in my T-zone area by the latter part of the day. But with this product I just glow and keep glowing, and dew dew dew it all day long, lol, NO LIE!! (Oops! Dang it, sorry about the cheesiness again! Lol)!  I never have to reapply it either, which is wonderful. It's perfect for wearing on a cozy weekend snuggled up with your significant other when you still wanna look gorgeous and sexy but don't want to put on a lot of makeup etc. With this, I can just skip the primer and even the moisturizer (but I still try to at least get some sunscreen in there, which we all know is very important), which saves me a ton of time and it also allows me to be able to go out to run errands, etc. without worrying about my makeup/skin/how I look! And for such an affordable price it's a very rare value!! Believe me, please, when I say that this product is true ""magic-in-a-bottle"" that smashes all those other similar products to bits! I'm so confident about this product that I just felt I HAD to finally write a review (after using it for months now with so many positive experiences wearing it). I want all women to know that they CAN, VERY EASILY, get that perfect, model-like, airbrushed, naked, glowing, dewy, no-makeup look without looking oily and greasy all day - that look which I had literally given up on ever looking like and blaming it on my skin or just thinking something was wrong with me lol - it's obviously the products we choose to wear, NOT us! I feel so naturally beautiful when wearing this and I've had so many people, even strangers, compliment me on my skin and ask how they could get their skin to look so youthful and glowing exactly like mine. And, get this - one was an actual, genuine pretty physician herself who asked me!! She asked me to write down what the product was so she could get a bottle of her own ""magic""! NOT KIDDING!! Ok, so I apologize how long this review got, and if you made it this far, kudos to you! Like I said, I just REALLY want to share my success with this product and give e.l.f. a great review of course!  And I'm not ""sexist"" etc. either - hey, ANY HUMAN BEING can and will love using this if they want that youthful, glowy/dewy look! Give it a try! If you don't like it, obviously you can return it, and if you somehow miss the return deadline or something, you won't be kicking yourself because it's such an affordable beauty product! All you have to gain is gorgeous, glowing, jaw-dropping skin and no need to wear any other makeup unless you want to!  Sometimes I'll rub in e.l.f.'s liquid blush in Rose to Slay and use their glowing contour and highlighting tubes in fair to light, Candlelit Campaign, etc. for a bit more beautiful, natural color to my face. I absolutely love love love these 3 e.l.f. products!!  5/5 STARS ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è

The e.l.f. Halo Glow Liquid Filter is a game-changer for those seeking a natural, dewy complexion without the heaviness of a traditional foundation. I use powder foundation often, but it's not as dewy or glowy as this product or a liquid foundation in general. With a lot of my friends saying this is is perfect balance between coverage and comfort, I was eager to put this product to the test.The first thing that struck me about the e.l.f. Halo Glow Liquid Filter is its sheer coverage and lightweight finish. It glides onto the skin effortlessly, giving a light wash of color to even out the skin tone. I use concealer to cover up dark marks and my hormonal acne. I love wearing this everyday because of its lightweight formula is a breath of fresh air compared to heavy foundations that can leave your skin feeling suffocated.One of the standout features of this product is its ability to deliver a radiant glow that looks both natural and healthy. It's like capturing the perfect ""lit-from-within"" look without the need for highlighters, foundation, or a lot of extra products. It's really a one and done! The subtle shimmer in the formula catches the light beautifully, giving your skin a luminous boost that lasts all day.The only downside is the limited shade range. While the e.l.f. Halo Glow Liquid Filter is a wonderful option for those with medium-toned skin, it falls short in accommodating individuals with darker or paler complexions. This oversight is disappointing, as makeup should be inclusive and accessible to everyone.In conclusion, the e.l.f. Halo Glow Liquid Filter is a fantastic choice for those who want a sheer, lightweight, and radiant finish that's leagues ahead of heavy foundations. It effortlessly achieves a natural and healthy glow that enhances your beauty. However, e.l.f. needs to seriously expand its shade range to cater to a broader spectrum of skin tones, so that everyone can enjoy this glowing sensation!

I love this foundation it has multiple coverage options, lasts all day, and easy to blend. If wanting more of a full coverage/last all day effect use a brush to apply, but if you could care less and just want it blended use a sponge. I like that not only does this product look super pretty and natural- it has the perfect glow. Expensive look for less than half the price.I use this, concealer for dark areas, and a translucent powder. Contour prn.Also: I have super sensitive skin with occasional blemishes.

First off, I have to say I absolutely love elf and most of my makeup staples are from them! It‚??s affordable and they are great quality and works just as good if not better than some high end products.It took me a while to finally purchase this item after the whole hype but I finally got my hands on them as I was looking for something that can provide a dewy hydrated look while having slight coverage (something that can even out my skin tone but still show my imperfections -freckles, acne scars and whatnot). When I tried this product my first reaction was that it was definitely more lotion like and as I rubbed the product into my skin using my fingers it left a lot of streaks and was hard to blend and felt like it was sitting on top of my skin. But overall I still really enjoy the product because it gave me what I was looking for and I just use a brush application method to avoid the streaks! And yes, it is super glowy like all the reviews say. So much that I might not wear it completely on its own because it looks a bit too metallic and unnatural on myself but it‚??s great to add another shear tint to balance it out ( I add 1-2 drops of the L‚??Or√©al tinted serum)

This formula is SO GOOD. I‚??ve gone through so many foundations in my makeup wearing days and this one truly is incredible. It feels so light but gives good coverage. It‚??s not a full coverage foundation but that‚??s exactly what I wanted. It allows for concealer and bronzer to not look so caked on after this is applied as a base and looks more like natural skin. Goes on smoothly and is a really good price.

I thought the color would be a little too dark for me, but it turned out perfect. It isn‚??t too thick but still covers enough so you don‚??t even need foundation! It was easy to blend, didn‚??t dry my skin out, and lasted all night. I use the Lumi Glotion by L‚??Oreal as a base, then the liquid filter and the color turns out perfect. I‚??m bottom right in the photo, and I went right to bed when I got home from our girls‚?? night (a few drinks were had) without removing the makeup. The product stayed on overnight! I recommend using the elf Power Grip Dewy Setting Spray on top for the perfect glow. This is a must have!

I was watching a make up artist on you tube expressing how surprised she was how great this is.  She said its better then the expensive stuff. I agree it's not expensive & it works great.it covers great & is not heavy looking. It is a little dark. I ordered medium beige. I have olive skin tone & it works for me.

I love this product. Shade 3.5 is perfection for fair olive skin. It makes my skin look like I wish it looked like naturally!!! It‚??s not too orange. It is a bit too shiny. And it‚??s much thicker than a d bronzi. The d bronzi has a better formula. This has more glitter and dries down a bit. My oily skin looks much worse at the end of the day when I use this product. No amounts of touch ups or blotting can remedy. I‚??ve tried. It also breaks me out (which a lot of drug store products do. I wish I knew what ingredient was doing it) I continue to use it for days when I want no make up looks and don‚??t need it to look good all day because the color is sooooo nuanced and good. If they would make it in a gel version no shimmer id deal with the breakout just for the color. Fair olive toned girls know the struggle of everything being too pink or orange!! Nothing else I‚??ve ever tried matches me this good :(

I really like this product. I'm happy I got the right shade for my light olive skin, but I also like that it's very light coverage and dewy for certain summertime looks (especially evening makeup since it's SO glowy). It kind of reminds me of the glass skin/glazed donut look which I've always loved even if it goes in and out of fashion. If you want this to be more of a daytime product, though, I would probably use it conservatively and mix it with a similar consistency BB or CC cream (my favorite is the IT cosmetics one).

I am still so amazed by this phenomenal product even months after I received it!! My use of the one word ""WOW"" is really all you need to know lol. I've tried sooooo many other products claiming to give you that ""dewy, glowy"" look without making you look greasy and oily...but sadly, they always did, and until I found this AMAZING product, I was only wasting more of my hard-earned money on more pricey products that promised the moon when all they ever delivered was grease/oil on my face! Yuck! So of course I was a bit skeptical about giving this product a chance, but I do overall like most e.l.f. products (yes, I admit I've used some pretty bad ones from them, but hopefully by now they've improved those previous low-quality products I had tried; I mean, haven't we all basically experienced disappointment with pretty much every mainstream beauty brand we try out? AT LEAST once, anyway)? Well, back to this product review. Thought I'd give it a try too because I've also always loved e.l.f.'s prices, and figured if I didn't like it, I could just return it anyway and it's not like I'd be out tons of money if for some reason I couldn't return it.  I think the e.l.f. brand has also became so much more successful and big not only to growing the selection of its products but also improving their quality. In addition, a huge part of their success (imo anyways) is that they've always stayed pretty true to their price range/category for their products (and that price category is wayyyyy more affordable for pretty much ANY woman - YAY FOR US AND YAY FOR E.L.F.)!! This product comes in a heavier glass bottle, so you have to be a bit careful not to drop and break it (duhhh I know but had to mention it)!  But it's also partially heavy not because of just the glass bottle but also because you get a decent amount of the actual product inside the bottle! I have tons of other similar products, most though are in fairly small tubes; sure, they can't break like glass bottles can but they also don't hold a nice amount of product like this one does. Granted, you don't need a ton of highlighter in general; one doesn't want to look like they just walked through some type of weird glitter factory (btw, absolutely NO GLITTER in this, not even a tiny trace of any, so yayyyy!) - but again, just emphasizing how much product you get for the price and what a great value it is compared to most others I've tried, which is a big deal to me (I'm not super rich lol, and affordable, amazing products are very hard to come by, as I think most of us can relate to).

I had some hope but not a ton of it as I opened up that glass bottle. Then I began to use the larger doe foot applicator (it comes with the product) to apply a few various-sized dots on my face (about the sizes of nickels and dimes, etc.).  I thought the applicator was pretty easy to use and it smoothly applied a good, decent amount of product to my face. I  dotted the liquid onto my chin, cheeks, around/under my eyes (careful not to get too close to my eyes, common sense), a bit along the bridge of my nose, my forehead, and then my temple areas.

I love this product. Shade 3.5 is perfection for fair olive skin. It makes my skin look like I wish it looked like naturally!!! It‚??s not too orange. It is a bit too shiny. And it‚??s much thicker than a d bronzi. The d bronzi has a better formula. This has more glitter and dries down a bit. My oily skin looks much worse at the end of the day when I use this product. No amounts of touch ups or blotting can remedy. I‚??ve tried. It also breaks me out (which a lot of drug store products do. I wish I knew what ingredient was doing it) I continue to use it for days when I want no make up looks and don‚??t need it to look good all day because the color is sooooo nuanced and good. If they would make it in a gel version no shimmer id deal with the breakout just for the color. Fair olive toned girls know the struggle of everything being too pink or orange!! Nothing else I‚??ve ever tried matches me this good :(

I really like this product. I'm happy I got the right shade for my light olive skin, but I also like that it's very light coverage and dewy for certain summertime looks (especially evening makeup since it's SO glowy). It kind of reminds me of the glass skin/glazed donut look which I've always loved even if it goes in and out of fashion. If you want this to be more of a daytime product, though, I would probably use it conservatively and mix it with a similar consistency BB or CC cream (my favorite is the IT cosmetics one).

Very pretty soft velvety pink. Well made. Keeps my hair back doesn‚??t slip forward & not snug behind my ears. Will buy another one for travel. Also comes in a super cute box not some plastic bag. Highly recommend ???

My review headline is kind of dumb now that I'm reading it because obviously a white headband that you wear to wash your dirty face with is going to get dirty. This is the viral headband that every influencer wears in their GRWM videos and I am a sheep who needed to get it, too. I do like it and wear it basically every morning and night. I guess I could wash it?? Haven't tried yet...but just be aware that eventually it will get a little dingy.

The Glow Recipe PHA  BHA Face Toner is a game-changer for achieving that coveted glass skin! It effectively minimizes pores and gently exfoliates, leaving my skin feeling smooth and hydrated. The combination of PHA, BHA, hyaluronic acid, and watermelon extract is refreshing and nourishing. Plus, the 40ml size is perfect for travel or trying out before committing to a larger bottle. Definitely a must-have in my skincare routine! Highly recommend for anyone looking to improve their skin texture and hydration.

This is a HG life changing product. In combination with my other skin care items (some of the same brand and some not) this serum has drastically improved the look and feel of my skin. If I ever don‚??t use it for even a few days, I notice it right away.This serum has made my skin smoother, more hydrated, reduced pore size and minimizes fine lines. It gives my skin a lit from within glow that just can‚??t be replicated with any other product and provides a plumping bouncy effect to my skin.I use it nightly in conjunction with the Herbivore Moon Fruit serum and Tatcha Dewy Skin Cream. I alternate with using the Pomegranate Peptide Firming Serum and the Strawberry BHA Pore serum in conjunction.I don‚??t use it under makeup because it‚??s a little too tacky and doesn‚??t play well with my primer, but I haven‚??t felt I needed it more than at night.I have sensitive skin that is prone to eczema and this does not irritate my skin, cause redness, breakouts or sting.I‚??m 41 and since using this for almost 2 years at this point I get complimented on my skin multiple times a week on average and people are surprised when they learn my age. A lot of my co-workers still think I‚??m in my late 20‚??s. It‚??s that good.I like to use a skincare roller to really push my products into my skin (I have a review ofThe one I use which is a dupe of the Nurse Jamie one). I swear it really helps with absorbency rather that just applying with fingers and calling it a night.

This is the one product I own, that I refuse to get low on. It literally says it in the description but its accurate- it makes your skin feel dewy, hydrated and smooth.

I do like this product and do feel that it is moisturizing. However, I feel like when I use it in the morning, it makes my cheeks a tad red throughout the day. I don't seem to have that issue with other moisturizers. It smells very nice too. Also, another negative is the bottle. After the product is low, you'll need to take the top off and use the rest of the product as there is quite a good amount left in the bottom. Uncertain if I'll buy this again or not still.

This is a great makeup remover melting balm. I've tried more expensive ones and this is just a good, if not better.This remover takes off all my makeup, even waterproof mascara. It leaves my skin feeling soft and moisturized. I have sensitive skin and it doesn't irritate my skin at all. It does have a very light fresh scent, but I barely could smell it. It was not strong whatsoever.For $10, the size is good. You'll spend way more for other brands and get not much more. You don't need to use a ton of it to get the job done.This is a subscribe for me, no question!

I will never use makeup wipes again! This gets the job done so easily and so quickly. Even on harder makeup. It makes my skin feel soft and hydrated after each use.

As someone who takes their skincare routine seriously, I'm always on the lookout for products that deliver results. That's why I was excited to try out the e.l.f. SKIN Mini Holy Hydration, it exceeded all my expectations.Let's start with its effectiveness as a makeup remover. This balm melts away even the toughest waterproof makeup effortlessly, leaving my skin feeling clean and refreshed. The formula is gentle yet powerful, effectively dissolving makeup without stripping my skin of its natural oils. Plus, the added infusion of hyaluronic acid provides an extra boost of hydration, leaving my skin feeling soft and supple after each use.One of the things I love most about this cleanser is its versatility. Not only does it remove makeup like a dream, but it also doubles as a facial cleanser. I use it both morning and night to cleanse my skin of impurities, and it always leaves my complexion looking radiant and clear. The compact size of the mini version makes it perfect for travel, ensuring that I can maintain my skincare routine no matter where I go.The texture of the balm is luxurious and smooth, gliding effortlessly onto the skin. It feels like a treat to massage it into my skin, and the subtle, refreshing scent adds to the overall sensory experience. Plus, a little goes a long way, so despite its small size, the product lasts a surprisingly long time.In terms of value for money, this balm is a steal. The quality of the formula rivals that of high-end skincare brands, but at a fraction of the price. It's clear that e.l.f. has put a lot of thought and care into creating a product that delivers real results without breaking the bank.Whether you're a skincare enthusiast like me or just looking for a reliable makeup remover, this product is a must have in your beauty arsenal. Trust me, your skin will thank you.

When I first started double cleansing, I was using Clinique‚??s Take The Day Off, but it was so expensive.Although I loved it, I decided to try CeraVe‚??s cleansing balm, but the smell was hard to get passed. I finally found Banila Co.‚??s cleansing balm and had been using that for quite a while.When I saw that E. L. F. came out with their own, I knew I wanted to try it for the amazing price point! It did not disappoint! Although it does not clear make up as well as Banila Co. the first time, the texture is almost perfect and removes it fairly easily. It‚??s very lightweight and does not leave my eyes feeling foggy after wiping it with a wet face cloth. I am willing to compromise using a little bit more since the price is so reasonable.

I love this cleanser! It takes make up off like a boss and leaves skin feeling smooth. It rinses off well and does not leave an oily feel. It is easy to use, as you just massage it onto your dry face. I then wet a disposable face cleaning towel and wipe it off. It is a small jar, but a little goes a long way, so it seems like it will last. There is no obnoxious smell, and it does exactly what it says it does. Will definitely repurchase when I run out.

My usual cleansing balm was out of stock when I needed more, and since I enjoy other e.l.f. products I decided to give this a try.It works well for removing makeup and doesn't dry out my skin. I do typically follow it using another cleanser, because it does seem to leave a film on my skin, but on nights when I'm just rushing to get to bed and shorten my routine, I haven't noticed any negative impact of using this on its own and rinsing for a little longer, then putting on my moisturizer.I knocked off one star for one reason only: Holy cow, the fragrance is awful. It almost has an 'old lady perfume' scent, and the scent lingers (another reason I have to double cleanse). If it was fragrance free, I'd most likely continue purchasing it simply because it's performance is comparable to that of my usual cleansing balm and it comes at a lower price point. With the heavy fragrance though, I'm going to back to my previous product.

They don't joke when they say it melts makeup away. I tried this on waterproof eye makeup and I have never had my makeup removed so completely from any other cleanser I've tried before. I may have used a bit too much for just my eyes, to be fair, but it did do the job!What I will say is that I made a mistake not having a damp cloth or the water running before beginning to use this cleansing balm, because opening your eyes in the middle is NOT recommended. It didn't hurt or anything but it was kinda odd getting it into my eyes and trying to clean it out after the fact.Either way, I would seriously recommend this stuff! It's fabulous and the price is absolutely right!

I've never been one to use a primer but, as I have gotten a little older the heat and I do not get along as well which results in me sweating more...this primer helps my makeup stay on better despite the humid days of summer trying to melt it away!I'm a 40yo, pretty pale complected female and I often find it hard to find something that isn't too bold for my lighter complexion.  Anyone could use this primer since it is perfectly clear, which I love!It does not have an odor or make my skin feel oily in any way and it does not make me break out.  It's light but effective.  You definitely have to give it time to dry after application before putting your foundation on over top of it though...30 seconds to a minute is what I have found to be a good length of time.  The box says 30 seconds but I have not found anything over that to be problematic.Worth trying if you're in the market for a primer!

I recently tried the Elf makeup primer, and it has quickly become an essential part of my beauty routine. This primer creates a flawless base, smoothing out my skin and minimizing the appearance of pores and fine lines. It‚??s incredibly lightweight and absorbs quickly, leaving a silky finish without any greasiness. My foundation applies effortlessly on top and lasts all day without creasing or fading. I also love that it keeps my skin looking matte and fresh, even in humid conditions. Elf primer has truly enhanced my makeup game, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a reliable and effective primer!

Elf primer has truly enhanced my makeup game, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a reliable and effective primer!

This brand has really come out with some amazing products, but this primer is the BEST from their line. It creates such a clean and even base and helps keep your make up on all day without flaking, smudging, or caking up. Really easy way to set your base and make your make up last!!

I used to buy super expensive makeup products, thinking they were better than mass brands. Elf has changed the game in that regard. I love this primer! It's sticky and hydrating, and my makeup goes nowhere throughout the day. I only wish it came in a bigger component.

I saw this as a recommendation on the today‚??s show the other day and I thought for the price I would try it out. I don‚??t wear much makeup but my under eye wrinkles ruin the small amount of concealer I use, this fixes that perfectly and I love it gives you a glow and isn‚??t matte.  I found it to be a game changer for me plus it‚??s cruelty free.

This was a great price for this product. Many saying its a dupe for Pixi.  I'm new to cream & liquid blushes, so I'm trying some out on the low end of the pricing scale to see of I like using them. I'm a bit older and notice skin changes (dullness, dryness) where maybe a cream or liquid blush might be better than a powder. The color payoff on this product is nice and light, but the color is noticeable. And the blush part came intact in the tube in my delivery (as opposed to some pics i saw posted on the reviews here where it fell apart). But since I had an issue with another brand's cream blush in a tube, I realize all these cream blushes in a push up tube might not be suitable for travel (business or leisure), especially in warmer months. So it's staying put at home where I will use it there.

This blush stick is just like the one I keep seeing all over TikTok, but better! It's inexpensive, yet so high quality. I blend it in with my beauty blender and it provides such a natural sun-kissed tone to my cheeks and nose.

It's nice and smooth going on and it's pretty and shiny, but it's definitely not cherry.  In fact, it seems like there was no color at all when I put it on. I considered returning it but since it is a pretty shiny and it feels nice on my lips I'm keeping it. If you want just a nice shiny lip gloss it works for that, or maybe to put it on top of a colored lipstick. But if you're looking to color your lips and have a gloss it's not for you.

I got the both the blush and the contour and the contour was literally perfect so i had really high hopes for the blush.

As a beginner to using blush, this is the first liquid blush I've tried and it's AMAZING! I only need to use 1 dot since it's super pigmented. I have normal to oily skin and it works great! No patchiness, no pilling, blends easily. Keep in mind that it does dry quickly so you need to work fast.

I have very fair, very cool toned skin. Anything with even a HINT of warmth looks even warmer on me (like like those with warm undertones who use anything even slightly cool looks even cooler toned on them). It‚??s hard finding good blush shades for my very cool skin. I‚??ll get a pink and it ends up looking peach if it has a little warmth to it (and many do, although now the cool toned baby pink has become more popular, finding a pink that works for me hasn‚??t been as hard as it used to be). But I found dusty pinks, mauves, purple, berry, and plum tones look best on me. With berry tones, I usually need to be careful since I‚??m very fair and most are deeper in color. They can also lean warm and end up looking more like a red on me than a berry. The shade ‚??Night Drive‚?ù in the first photo looked like it was a beautiful dusty rose color. In the photo showing all the shades swatched together, it looked like a beautiful plum color. But then in the other photo where it showed the 3 new shades and had a shade description, the color looked like it was more of a reddish berry, but was described as a deep plum red. To me it‚??s either plum (a purple toned shade) or red, but I guess ‚??deep plum red‚?ù means it‚??s a berry with a red tone. I was hoping it would end up looking more like it did in the first photo (a kind of dusty rose color) or the swatch photo (a beautiful plum color), and not be too red toned.They have both matte and shimmer finishes. 4 shades have a shimmer finish and 11 shades have a matte finish. Some shades come in both finishes - matte and shimmer - while some of the others only come in one finish (either matte or shimmer). I was happy when I saw the shade I wanted (‚??Night Drive‚?ù) was one of the matte shades. I don‚??t like my blushes to be shimmery. Shimmery usually means glittery, which I don‚??t like. Shimmer/glitter can accentuate texture and fine lines, plus depending on the shimmer (if it‚??s larger shimmer/glitter particles), then that can migrate to the rest of my face. And even if there‚??s no glitter, dewy/glowy finishes still can accentuate texture and fine lines. So I prefer my blushes to be matte, and I can add glow another way if I want it.In person, the shade is more like it appeared in the photo showing the 3 new shades with the description, and I‚??d definitely agree with the description of ‚??deep plum red.‚?ù It definitely is a kind of plum color but with a red tone to it. On my very cool toned skin, it shows more as a red than I wanted, but it still looks nice.The component is nice! It‚??s a plastic, hexagonal tube that has a soft, baby pink kind of color that has a frosted gradient look to it. The top twists off to reveal a pointed sponge tip that you can easily dot onto the cheeks. When the sponge tip goes into the bottom of the tube, there‚??s a piece inside that I guess is kind of like a stopper to keep too much product from coming out. I was worried how that‚??ll work once I‚??ve used these a lot and they start to get low - will I still be able to get product on the sponge? Because with that stopper in there, it seems like once it gets low and the product isn‚??t hitting that spot, I wonder how it gets the product? But only time will tell. So far, I‚??ve been using this shade off and on for 5 months and it doesn‚??t seem like there‚??s any less product on the sponge tip when I take it out now than there was when I first started using it. So I‚??m happy about that.You get enough product on the sponge tip where you can use the tip to dot it on your cheeks. That‚??s how I‚??ve been preferring it when I apply it. I take the pointed tip, and do a couple tiny dots. Then I take my fave brush for any liquid/cream product (Elf Putty Brush) and dab the product out. I stamp the brush over the dots to spread the color out where I want it, and then keep lightly stamping to blend it to where I want it. It blends out nice and easy. I prefer doing dots on one side, blending that out, then doing the dots on the other side. I have tried it where I apply the dots to both sides and blend out one side then go to the other, and I‚??m still able to blend the other side easily. I also tried applying some to the back of my hand (stamping the sponge onto the back of my hand, then dabbing my brush into it to pick some product up and spreading it evenly on the brush) then going in and applying it on my cheeks. This worked well to, but I felt like I wasted a decent amount of product doing it this way. I had to keep putting more on the back of my hand to pick up more product. But this is a good way to do it if you feel like it‚??s too pigmented or want a slight wash of color.Unfortunately, even on my very dry skin, this does NOT look matte AT ALL. It looks REALLY dewy. Thankfully, it doesn‚??t have any shimmer to it. But it has a very dewy look to it. Because of that, I feel like it can sometimes pick up product underneath (like my foundation), which I HATE! I at the same time I got this, I also got 2 shades of the SheGlam Sun Sculpt Bronzers and I LOVE those. They apply nice and easy, dry down and set on their own, and have a matte finish but not too matte where it looks dry. They‚??re beautiful. I was expecting the formula of this blush, being a matte finish, to be similar to those. So I was pretty disappointed when it wasn‚??t. I have to be really careful when applying it to make sure my foundation underneath doesn‚??t lift up. I have to usually wait a bit after I apply my foundation before I apply this, which just isn‚??t always easy to do. I use a fan sometimes to speed the process up. But, it‚??s just not something I like having to deal with. I‚??ve used tons of liquid/cream blush formulas and I‚??ve never had issues with them lifting any of my foundations underneath when using my HG brush for them (the Elf Putty Brush). There‚??s just something about that brush that‚??s always magic with liquid blushes. But NOT with this one. I also tried using a sponge and my fingers, and still had the same thing. I‚??ve tried this with different foundation formulas and finishes. This seems to work best with a matte foundation, but even then, I need to be careful when applying it so foundation doesn‚??t lift up underneath. I tried setting my face with powder before applying this and that didn‚??t work at all! It just made this look patchy and uneven. So, I just need to let my foundation set completely on its own before applying this and be careful when applying it so it doesn‚??t lift my foundation underneath. Then, I need to put a tiny bit of powder of this so that it doesn‚??t look so dewy.Overall, this one wasn‚??t a win for me. I LOVE the Sun Sculpts (in shade Tawny Amber for bronzer and Soft Tan for contour). If the formula on this blush was like those, I‚??d love this too. But, unfortunately, it‚??s not. It‚??s glowy when it‚??s supposed to be matte and just finicky to work with. So this isn‚??t something I‚??d recommend unless you WANT a dewy blush that isn‚??t shimmery/glittery and don‚??t mind it might be finicky to work with and lift up your foundation. I give it 3 stars. It‚??s okay, but not great.

I see now why everyone loves this brand of blushes. I see them all over my TikTok. I ordered the peach and it livens up my pale olive skin for the perfect natural blush/sun kissed skin look. Pale cool olive skin can be such a pain for blush shades (well all makeup shades really) but this is beautiful and blends super easy with just a few taps of your fingers. Will buy again, I can see this being a staple in my make up routine. Even looks cute as a cheek flush on the no make up/no foundation days. For reverence I am 42, my skin is on the dryer side and this looks great.

Actually I was looking for a little lighter color in shade but this color is equally good. What I like about liquid blushes is they sits into your skin and looks like your real skin they don‚??t look artificial or powdery on your face. Worth buying for this price.

As a beginner to using blush, this is the first liquid blush I've tried and it's AMAZING! I only need to use 1 dot since it's super pigmented. I have normal to oily skin and it works great! No patchiness, no pilling, blends easily. Keep in mind that it does dry quickly so you need to work fast.

I have very fair, very cool toned skin. Anything with even a HINT of warmth looks even warmer on me (like like those with warm undertones who use anything even slightly cool looks even cooler toned on them). It‚??s hard finding good blush shades for my very cool skin. I‚??ll get a pink and it ends up looking peach if it has a little warmth to it (and many do, although now the cool toned baby pink has become more popular, finding a pink that works for me hasn‚??t been as hard as it used to be). But I found dusty pinks, mauves, purple, berry, and plum tones look best on me. With berry tones, I usually need to be careful since I‚??m very fair and most are deeper in color. They can also lean warm and end up looking more like a red on me than a berry. The shade ‚??Night Drive‚?ù in the first photo looked like it was a beautiful dusty rose color. In the photo showing all the shades swatched together, it looked like a beautiful plum color. But then in the other photo where it showed the 3 new shades and had a shade description, the color looked like it was more of a reddish berry, but was described as a deep plum red. To me it‚??s either plum (a purple toned shade) or red, but I guess ‚??deep plum red‚?ù means it‚??s a berry with a red tone. I was hoping it would end up looking more like it did in the first photo (a kind of dusty rose color) or the swatch photo (a beautiful plum color), and not be too red toned.They have both matte and shimmer finishes. 4 shades have a shimmer finish and 11 shades have a matte finish. Some shades come in both finishes - matte and shimmer - while some of the others only come in one finish (either matte or shimmer). I was happy when I saw the shade I wanted (‚??Night Drive‚?ù) was one of the matte shades. I don‚??t like my blushes to be shimmery. Shimmery usually means glittery, which I don‚??t like. Shimmer/glitter can accentuate texture and fine lines, plus depending on the shimmer (if it‚??s larger shimmer/glitter particles), then that can migrate to the rest of my face. And even if there‚??s no glitter, dewy/glowy finishes still can accentuate texture and fine lines. So I prefer my blushes to be matte, and I can add glow another way if I want it.In person, the shade is more like it appeared in the photo showing the 3 new shades with the description, and I‚??d definitely agree with the description of ‚??deep plum red.‚?ù It definitely is a kind of plum color but with a red tone to it. On my very cool toned skin, it shows more as a red than I wanted, but it still looks nice.The component is nice! It‚??s a plastic, hexagonal tube that has a soft, baby pink kind of color that has a frosted gradient look to it. The top twists off to reveal a pointed sponge tip that you can easily dot onto the cheeks. When the sponge tip goes into the bottom of the tube, there‚??s a piece inside that I guess is kind of like a stopper to keep too much product from coming out. I was worried how that‚??ll work once I‚??ve used these a lot and they start to get low - will I still be able to get product on the sponge? Because with that stopper in there, it seems like once it gets low and the product isn‚??t hitting that spot, I wonder how it gets the product? But only time will tell. So far, I‚??ve been using this shade off and on for 5 months and it doesn‚??t seem like there‚??s any less product on the sponge tip when I take it out now than there was when I first started using it. So I‚??m happy about that.You get enough product on the sponge tip where you can use the tip to dot it on your cheeks. That‚??s how I‚??ve been preferring it when I apply it. I take the pointed tip, and do a couple tiny dots. Then I take my fave brush for any liquid/cream product (Elf Putty Brush) and dab the product out. I stamp the brush over the dots to spread the color out where I want it, and then keep lightly stamping to blend it to where I want it. It blends out nice and easy. I prefer doing dots on one side, blending that out, then doing the dots on the other side. I have tried it where I apply the dots to both sides and blend out one side then go to the other, and I‚??m still able to blend the other side easily. I also tried applying some to the back of my hand (stamping the sponge onto the back of my hand, then dabbing my brush into it to pick some product up and spreading it evenly on the brush) then going in and applying it on my cheeks. This worked well to, but I felt like I wasted a decent amount of product doing it this way. I had to keep putting more on the back of my hand to pick up more product. But this is a good way to do it if you feel like it‚??s too pigmented or want a slight wash of color.Unfortunately, even on my very dry skin, this does NOT look matte AT ALL. It looks REALLY dewy. Thankfully, it doesn‚??t have any shimmer to it. But it has a very dewy look to it. Because of that, I feel like it can sometimes pick up product underneath (like my foundation), which I HATE! I at the same time I got this, I also got 2 shades of the SheGlam Sun Sculpt Bronzers and I LOVE those. They apply nice and easy, dry down and set on their own, and have a matte finish but not too matte where it looks dry. They‚??re beautiful. I was expecting the formula of this blush, being a matte finish, to be similar to those. So I was pretty disappointed when it wasn‚??t. I have to be really careful when applying it to make sure my foundation underneath doesn‚??t lift up. I have to usually wait a bit after I apply my foundation before I apply this, which just isn‚??t always easy to do. I use a fan sometimes to speed the process up. But, it‚??s just not something I like having to deal with. I‚??ve used tons of liquid/cream blush formulas and I‚??ve never had issues with them lifting any of my foundations underneath when using my HG brush for them (the Elf Putty Brush). There‚??s just something about that brush that‚??s always magic with liquid blushes. But NOT with this one. I also tried using a sponge and my fingers, and still had the same thing. I‚??ve tried this with different foundation formulas and finishes. This seems to work best with a matte foundation, but even then, I need to be careful when applying it so foundation doesn‚??t lift up underneath. I tried setting my face with powder before applying this and that didn‚??t work at all! It just made this look patchy and uneven. So, I just need to let my foundation set completely on its own before applying this and be careful when applying it so it doesn‚??t lift my foundation underneath. Then, I need to put a tiny bit of powder of this so that it doesn‚??t look so dewy.Overall, this one wasn‚??t a win for me. I LOVE the Sun Sculpts (in shade Tawny Amber for bronzer and Soft Tan for contour). If the formula on this blush was like those, I‚??d love this too. But, unfortunately, it‚??s not. It‚??s glowy when it‚??s supposed to be matte and just finicky to work with. So this isn‚??t something I‚??d recommend unless you WANT a dewy blush that isn‚??t shimmery/glittery and don‚??t mind it might be finicky to work with and lift up your foundation. I give it 3 stars. It‚??s okay, but not great.

I see now why everyone loves this brand of blushes. I see them all over my TikTok. I ordered the peach and it livens up my pale olive skin for the perfect natural blush/sun kissed skin look. Pale cool olive skin can be such a pain for blush shades (well all makeup shades really) but this is beautiful and blends super easy with just a few taps of your fingers. Will buy again, I can see this being a staple in my make up routine. Even looks cute as a cheek flush on the no make up/no foundation days. For reverence I am 42, my skin is on the dryer side and this looks great.

My 16y.o. daughter originally asked for face wipes, but then asked for Micellar water instead since we have about 1k cotton pads already.  I followed up with her 2x since we bought it.  She happily gushed about the product, citing that it works much better than the disposable makeup wipes she used to use.  A few weeks later, I hit her up again.  She had been using this in lieu of face wipes for almost 3 weeks at that time.  She showed me before and after, as well as what came off onto the cotton pad which was noticeable.  She went on to say how the moisturizing really seems to work and that she loves how her skin feels regularly now.  She also reminded me that the cotton pads that she uses instead of the makeup wipes are actually more biodegradable and better for the environment, which makes me happy.  She would have been through the thing of wipes by now, but has about half the bottle left atm.  I was thinking that the Micellar water would be more expensive in the long run along with the cotton pads, but I think that now she is getting a better product for roughly (if not less than) the same price.  She likes other Garnier products so this is a great addition for her.  I'm a single dad and just trying to keep up with the times.  I'm glad they have affordable products like this on Amazon which, with the reviews, helps me figure out what is best for her (and best value for me) from the comfort of my home.

The first thing I noticed when I opened the bottle was the smell--hard to describe but not pleasant. It looks and feels great on my skin though, with a slightly dewy finish that is great for mature skin like mine but may not be a plus for those with oilier skin. It's pretty much undetectable on my skin apart from the fact that my skin looks better. I bought the shade oro. I thought it may be too dark, but it's not at all. The coverage is surprisingly good for a serum foundation. The fact that it's SPF 40 was a huge selling point for me. I should add that I had my husband do a sniff test on my face once I'd applied the foundation and he didn't notice a bad smell. I guess it dissipates when out of the bottle. I will definitely buy this again. I would give it 5 stars if not for the smell.

I don‚??t think this makeup is for people with oily skin. The finish on the product is dewy to begin with but the makeup just never sets! Like never. I‚??ve seen the responses from Ilia about setting it with their powder and I‚??ve done that. It still seems too sticky for my taste. And it claims to reduce the look of pores (I‚??ve seen those adds pop up all over). It does not reduce the look of pores or hide any imperfections you might have. I don‚??t think this product does any favors for my 43 year old skin. My advice: don‚??t buy into the hype in the targeted ads. Save your money. This product is not worth half the price I paid for it. Finally, if you have any sensitivity to scent you will not like this product. It smells like I‚??ve put honey on my face!

The box and product was a lot smaller than I thought but it is called mini for a reason! The lip tints are super cute as well as the box it comes in. the lip tints themselves have a nice coconut smell to them and the color intensifies depending on how many layers you put on‚?®!

Just got it and only used it for 3 days, but it's suuuuper cute! The case is adorable, love that the stains are in mini little tubes and good variety in the colors. Pretty good stain left on the lips. The colors are very flattering on Asian skin tones, used it on me and a friend.Will probably come back to update review after prolonged use.* Update: used for 8 hours where I went outside, reapplied sunscreen, and ate lunch and a snack. Lip stain performed AWESOME! I felt like if I didn't eat, the color would NOT have budged an inch.

This set is a really good value because it‚??s less than $10 and you get six different Colors of tints. However, the quality is not going to be comparable to some of the more expensive brands you find at most beauty Retailers. The tints are kind of sticky when they first come on however, this will eventually Stop after the first hour. The tints themselves range in colors between more natural and a more vibrant, red color, so you do have a decent variety of color all of which can be blended into be a more natural appearance. The Container they come in is adorable and perfect to keep them in, So you can think of it as a bonus item. They don‚??t last a super long time, so you will have to retouch them Throughout the day. The bottles themselves are quite small, but if you like to blend them in a little does go along way. This kit would be great for a kid or teen starting out with make up, As it isn‚??t too expensive for a gift and the shades aren‚??t too bold. Overall, though, they are fun to play around with, and if you want to start using tints and don‚??t have a ton of money, these are an option

The packaging is great and very cute, but the marketing for product is not very accurate?It should be described as a water tint.The ease of application isn‚??t great just because you have to scrape off the applicator so much to get a tiny amount so the colors can shine.There isn‚??t any smell I could pick up.The texture was actually pretty nice. When you use a very small amount to get the colors to match then it dries down and feels pretty light weight, not sticky, and skin like.This is absolutely a layering product. You‚??d need a gloss or lip oil to go on top- with this you could use a higher shine chapstick as well if you like the feel more. The lip stain doesn‚??t stay dewy and glossy after the first 10 minutes.Just to be clear for everyone this isn‚??t a peeling lip stain, it isn‚??t a dewy lip gloss. It‚??s an apply a small amount and let sit then put a top gloss.I think this could be a good product with better instructions, marketing, and tags for searches

Stains are great and natural and spreadable but the case and one stain had cracked because of poor shipping from the Amazon warehouse since it was packed with other heavy items and not properly padded. Amazon wants me to drive to Staples in order to send a broken and leaking case in order to send a replacement. Shame on you Amazon.

I really enjoyed the texture of the lip stick/tent, but it was a lot more brighter pigment than I expected. I prefer dark cherry tones instead of some of the more bright tones. The application was great, and felt like water almost. They are very pigmented, and a few of them did have some stickiness, but not to the consistency of a lip gloss or oil. They are smaller than expected, but I prefer something small. They‚??re easier to carry.  And the smell was not strong, but didn‚??t take on the strawberry smell or anything that I expected

### Review: NYX PROFESSIONAL MAKEUP Jumbo Multi-Use Face Highlighter Stick - Vanilla Ice Cream#### Rating: ‚??‚??‚??‚??‚?? (4/5)I recently added the NYX PROFESSIONAL MAKEUP Jumbo Multi-Use Face Highlighter Stick in Vanilla Ice Cream to my makeup collection, and it has quickly become one of my go-to products for achieving a radiant glow.#### What I Loved:**1. Super Creamy Texture:**The first thing I noticed about this highlighter stick is its incredibly creamy texture. It glides onto the skin effortlessly, making application a breeze. The formula is smooth and blendable, allowing for a seamless, natural-looking highlight.**2. Versatile and Multi-Use:**This highlighter stick is truly versatile. While it works beautifully on the high points of the face such as the cheekbones, brow bones, and the bridge of the nose, it can also be used on the eyelids for a subtle shimmer or on the cupid's bow for an extra pop. Its multi-use capability makes it a fantastic addition to any makeup bag.**3. Gorgeous Shade:**The Vanilla Ice Cream shade is stunning. It has a beautiful, pearlescent quality that adds a luminous glow to the skin without being overly glittery. It's perfect for both daytime and evening looks, providing a soft, radiant finish that enhances your natural beauty.#### Areas for Improvement:**1. Staying Power:**One thing to note is that this highlighter is not very long-lasting if you tend to rub your face. If you accidentally touch or rub your eyes, the product can come off quite easily. To ensure it stays put, I recommend setting it with a light dusting of translucent powder or using a setting spray.**2. Packaging:**While the jumbo size is great for ease of application, it might not be the most convenient for precise highlighting in smaller areas. However, using a brush or your fingers to blend can help achieve more detailed application.#### Final Thoughts:Overall, the NYX PROFESSIONAL MAKEUP Jumbo Multi-Use Face Highlighter Stick in Vanilla Ice Cream is a fantastic product for achieving a radiant, dewy look. Its creamy texture and beautiful shade make it a pleasure to use, and its versatility adds extra value. Just remember to avoid rubbing your face to maintain its gorgeous glow throughout the day.If you‚??re looking for an easy-to-apply, multi-functional highlighter that delivers a lovely, luminous finish, this one is definitely worth trying.

Ok whatttt i am actually so shocked this worked!! i was a bit skeptical when buying this at first bc it was rly cheap and no one added a pic of how it turned out when adding water, but i‚??m surprised it didn‚??t break!! I added some facial mist into it and cucumber (to spice it up a bit) which was actually such a good decision!! I‚??ve been used to icing my face with ice cubes only so this was a lottt easier. A tip i would like to add tho is that once it‚??s fully frozen, def run it under water especially the part with the hole bc that is where it gets kinda stuck, then instead of pulling it off, just twist it gently and then it gets easier to remove without breaking anything. Such a great and affordable product def recommend! ?´∂?èª

I bought this as a gift, so can't comment on actual use. However, I have several oobservations worh mentioning...The plug for the water hole at the top is not attached with a strap, so I'm afraid it could get lost in a short period of time. When I squeeze the empty item with the water plug inserted, air escapes around the plug. I suspect that if this were tipped over before freezing that water would leak out. Propping it upright in the freezer so it can't tip over would solve this issue. The heart shaped stone is pretty and smooth as glass and is what sold me on this for a Valentines Day gift. This also can work as a small ice pack, which is handy with a toddler. No instructions or labeling of any kind came with this item to explain what it is or does, and I expect there will be questions. I copied and printed all information from the item description to include with the gift.

I'm very impressed with this Elf concealer.  The color is perfect.  It blends right into my skin tone, covers and conceals my dark undereye shadows all day, while appearing flawless and virtually unnoticeable.  No need to ever go back to a more expensive product that didn't have nearly the staying power and coverage of this Elf Camo Concealer.  It is very easy to apply, a little goes a long way, very much a ""less is more"" type of product.  It has that just-right consistency and applys smoothly. I would highly recommend to anyone.

The e.l.f. Hydrating Camo Concealer in Deep Chestnut is a standout product with its lightweight, full-coverage formula that provides a satin finish. It effectively conceals, corrects, and highlights while hydrating the skin, making it ideal for all-day wear. The 0.20 fl oz size is perfect for targeted application, and with 25 shades available, it offers a great match for various skin tones.
"
383,"
I am a big fan of most e.l.f. products.  This looked like another amazing product I did not try.First, the applicator is amazing.  It is a big soft pawlike sponge. it is so big, you need to make sure you only apply a tiny bit ..a little goes a long way.I only use a small amount under the eyes.  It  is ok. not the most moisturizing and tends to crease a little more than other hydrating concealers. The color is also more warm than I would like.  more of an orange tone than a pink tone, at least on me.  I purchased the Fair Beige.I do love to use this on a large sun spot on my face as the applicator is large ,  it covers the spot well under makeup and lasts all day.  So I would purchase it again for that use.

Truthfully, this concealer is amazing (especially considering its price!).For reference, I usually only wear Rare Beauty‚??s eye brightener to cover up my dark circles on the daily. It doesn‚??t completely conceal them, which is the look I usually go for. I don‚??t like looking cakey or completely different than how I look without makeup, so the eye brightener is my go to. However, it‚??s rather pricey, so I wanted an alternative for at least some of the days when I wear makeup, and I would definitely say this product is great for that. It costs a fraction of the price, and it offers a lot more coverage. It is fairly moisturizing, and it stays put for a long time. I only use the lightest touch of it to avoid my aforementioned concerns, meaning it is lasting a lot longer too.In short, I use the eye brightener for really chill days or days when I am running late, since it is super easy to apply. While on days that I have more time to do my makeup or I want to look ever so slightly more put together, I will use the elf concealer.100% recommend for anyone that would like to cover up their dark circles without breaking the bank.

I love the elf brand products because they offer the same quality that high-end premium products offer. I am a former professional make up artist and are usually use only premium make up brands. For example, some of the brands that I have are make up forever, Mac, Lancome, Christian Dior, Trish McVoy, Bobby Brown, and the Sephora brand. I love finding make up that works, and that changes the way you feel. Most cheap brands of make up the ones that you find at the drugstore don‚??t offer the same smooth and glowing appearance that a premium brand does. I have never bought concealer from the drugstore. I would find that the concealer would either be too thick and application was difficult due to the fact it would end up looking cakey, would not blend smoothly so you could see the parts that I applied it too so much that it was very obvious that I had makeup on, it wouldn‚??t offer full coverage or even coverage that could hide imperfections such as redness around the nose and or dark circles. The color options at the drugstore were limited or were not good for someone who has yellow undertones. It would offer beige, pink or dark undertones but they were never similar to a real skin tone. It would either be too light or too dark or have too much beige. I have scarring on my face and body. The scars usually required me to apply thick, cakey, concealers that rubbed off onto clothing, gave skin a plastic fake looking appearance and difficult to apply. They also were expensive and I always had to reapply them during the day because they rubbed off onto everything. This concealer is waterproof (I can take a shower and it doesn‚??t rinse off, I can get into the water and swim and it doesn‚??t budge, it is sweat proof, lasts 24 hours, is the only concealer I have found this year that I can use on my body and it doesn‚??t transfer to my clothes. The fact that it is TRULY transfer proof is such a huge solution for me as I can now apply it to my scars on the chest and neck and arms and I have never gotten any stains from it. I can rub it with my hands, use a cloth to see if it rubs off it doesn‚??t. It does require a makeup remover because it‚??s almost semi permanent and requires special cleansing to remove completely. You need to have a concealer brush that is high quality to use for application because it will apply very thickly if you use the included sponge application brush. It dries almost immediately so you need to start with very little product and carefully layer it so that you don‚??t over apply. It is not a concealer that offers a completely, natural, no makeup look. I have yet to find one that does. But this concealer does exactly what it‚??s advertised to do. It is cheaper than most drugstore brands but when you research best makeup brands ELF is consistently on the list as a brand that offers designer, premium quality products, that mimic and even beat the premium expensive brands. What‚??s great is that you can rely on the entire product line to cover all your makeup needs. I can go to Walgreens, skip the multiple aisles of drugstore makeup brands (don‚??t even have to look at the new makeup featured) I just go to the ELF aisle. I am able to buy concealer, mascara, eyeliner, blush, eyebrow pencil, eyeshadow, makeup removers, makeup brushes, and it offers a good selection of primers that you can experiment with. I am able to spend under $100 and be able to put together a huge makeup kit. When I lost my huge, expensive special makeup kit (I have different kits for certain situations) I was so upset. I had spent over $600 on the makeup in that kit, I had makeup that I saved up for and most of the makeup was $50-$150 dollars per item. I had spent a ridiculous amount of time researching, saving up and trying out all the makeup in that lost kit. I also had a huge event I was attending where I was going to be photographed and representing a new business. So I almost skipped going because I didn‚??t have time to get a professional makeup appointment (realized the kit was missing a few hours before event) no one was available on such short notice (Ulta, Sephora, Nordstroms makeup brand selections were all required to be booked in advance (I tried MAC, Christian Dior, Lanc√¥me, Jean Juarez salon, Ulta in store makeup appointments were the same ) so I had to go to the drugstore for makeup or beg my mom to let me borrow hers. I went to store. I had read reviews from (makeup Alley, Ulta, new beauty & Allure to name a few, regarding drugstore makeup products that were as good as premium makeup) Elf was mentioned multiple times. So I went to the aisle and bought multiple options of concealers (3 different colors) all of the primers, 3 shades of blush, two mascara types, eye makeup remover for waterproof mascara, makeup remover for facial skin, and then I got a concealer brush, angled blush brush, foundation application brush, makeup sponge that could be used for all areas of face, eye lash curler. I couldn‚??t believe how cheap the makeup was (it is like Wet N Wild pricing but should be considered underpriced for the quality you get) my husband was really annoyed and concerned when he saw how full my cart was, I filled up an entire basket. He said it‚??s going to cost me $300 at least. Then I said let‚??s see. Went to the register and we both left the store in shock because I probably had purchased products that were worth $400 (yes makeup can easily add up to that amount especially when your buying all new stuff) but it cost us $120 dollars and we purchased over 20 items. I am hoping you try the concealer it is so cheap you can‚??t afford not to buy it and I recommend buying a few different shades of the concealer because you can mix them to match your skin tone perfectly and our skin color changes during the year. So try it! It‚??s a safe bet.

Arrived quickly and in good condition.My granddaughter's skin tone is pale and as such, she has a hard time finding the right shade of concealer.Leave it to Grandpa to know that Elf has everything a gal needs. I saw this 'fair warm' concealer, and having no knowledge of makeup save for self education, decided to buy it for her to see how she liked it.Oh my, was she happy with it! It was exactly the shade she's been trying to find for awhile now, and couldn't believe that I, a 'dude', could pick the right type of makeup for a gal.I told her that Grandfathers have super powers that no one knows about until you yourself become over sixty and let her ponder that as she happily applied her concealer and realized that Elf just gained a new customer for life.

It dries almost immediately so you need to start with very little product and carefully layer it so that you don‚??t over apply. It is not a concealer that offers a completely, natural, no makeup look. I have yet to find one that does. But this concealer does exactly what it‚??s advertised to do. It is cheaper than most drugstore brands but when you research best makeup brands ELF is consistently on the list as a brand that offers designer, premium quality products, that mimic and even beat the premium expensive brands. What‚??s great is that you can rely on the entire product line to cover all your makeup needs. I can go to Walgreens, skip the multiple aisles of drugstore makeup brands (don‚??t even have to look at the new makeup featured) I just go to the ELF aisle. I am able to buy concealer, mascara, eyeliner, blush, eyebrow pencil, eyeshadow, makeup removers, makeup brushes, and it offers a good selection of primers that you can experiment with. I am able to spend under $100 and be able to put together a huge makeup kit. When I lost my huge, expensive special makeup kit (I have different kits for certain situations) I was so upset. I had spent over $600 on the makeup in that kit, I had makeup that I saved up for and most of the makeup was $50-$150 dollars per item. I had spent a ridiculous amount of time researching, saving up and trying out all the makeup in that lost kit. I also had a huge event I was attending where I was going to be photographed and representing a new business. So I almost skipped going because I didn‚??t have time to get a professional makeup appointment (realized the kit was missing a few hours before event) no one was available on such short notice (Ulta, Sephora, Nordstroms makeup brand selections were all required to be booked in advance (I tried MAC, Christian Dior, Lanc√¥me, Jean Juarez salon, Ulta in store makeup appointments were the same ) so I had to go to the drugstore for makeup or beg my mom to let me borrow hers. I went to store. I had read reviews from (makeup Alley, Ulta, new beauty & Allure to name a few, regarding drugstore makeup products that were as good as premium makeup) Elf was mentioned multiple times. So I went to the aisle and bought multiple options of concealers (3 different colors) all of the primers, 3 shades of blush, two mascara types, eye makeup remover for waterproof mascara, makeup remover for facial skin, and then I got a concealer brush, angled blush brush, foundation application brush, makeup sponge that could be used for all areas of face, eye lash curler. I couldn‚??t believe how cheap the makeup was (it is like Wet N Wild pricing but should be considered underpriced for the quality you get) my husband was really annoyed and concerned when he saw how full my cart was, I filled up an entire basket. He said it‚??s going to cost me $300 at least. Then I said let‚??s see. Went to the register and we both left the store in shock because I probably had purchased products that were worth $400 (yes makeup can easily add up to that amount especially when your buying all new stuff) but it cost us $120 dollars and we purchased over 20 items. I am hoping you try the concealer it is so cheap you can‚??t afford not to buy it and I recommend buying a few different shades of the concealer because you can mix them to match your skin tone perfectly and our skin color changes during the year. So try it! It‚??s a safe bet.

Arrived quickly and in good condition.My granddaughter's skin tone is pale and as such, she has a hard time finding the right shade of concealer.Leave it to Grandpa to know that Elf has everything a gal needs. I saw this 'fair warm' concealer, and having no knowledge of makeup save for self education, decided to buy it for her to see how she liked it.Oh my, was she happy with it! It was exactly the shade she's been trying to find for awhile now, and couldn't believe that I, a 'dude', could pick the right type of makeup for a gal.I told her that Grandfathers have super powers that no one knows about until you yourself become over sixty and let her ponder that as she happily applied her concealer and realized that Elf just gained a new customer for life.

I recently bought the Cq acrylic Makeup Organizer and Storage White Skin Care Cosmetic Display Case for my 12-year-old daughter, and it's been fantastic! The sleek design adds elegance to her vanity, while the three clear drawers offer ample storage for her makeup and skincare products. It's durable, versatile, and keeps everything organized neatly. I highly recommend it for any young beauty enthusiast!

This organizer gave me back a good amount of counter space. Everything is easy to see and the pull tabs for the drawers are easy to install and surprisingly sturdy. I am an Urban Decay junkie so while it doesn‚??t fit my insane collection I just use the main staples and leave the rest under the sink to switch out depending on the season or just my mood.  Makes all your makeup nice and orderly.

These little sponges are really good quality and really good value compared to the other sponges and their price. The thickness is pretty consistent across the pack of sponges.

This is my first time using Korean beauty products. I had a skincare routine using mostly Cerave and other drugstore products. I knew I needed to find something different when my skin continued to break out and I had no healthy glow. So I decided to take a chance on Anua.First of all, I've never had a problem with my skin not being soft. My main problems are continuous breakouts on my forehead and chin area as well as redness under my nose and dull looking skin. I start my routine with this pore cleansing oil. I was skeptical at first because...oil? On my skin? But it smelled so good that I decided to give it a shot. I use just one pump and I massage it on my face for a good couple minutes. After using this for a couple days I did notice my skin was softer and starting to look healthier, but I new I was still missing something. So back to Amazon I went and I got the Anua pore cleansing foam.After using the pore oil, I rinse and follow up with the Anua pore deep cleansing foam, which also smells nice and clean. I lather it up and massage it on my face while paying special attention to my problem areas. After rinsing and patting my face dry, I can already see such a difference with my skin. After a few uses I was getting some glow back and the redness was fading.I decided to add more Korean products to my skincare routine and since Anua, I have also added BHA exfoliating toner  pads and Madagascar centella ampoule. The BHA pads I use directly after the Anua pore cleansing foam. They have a softer side and a rough side for when you need some extra scrubbing. They smell like tea tree oil, which I don't have a problem with but some people do. After using these I pat my face to let the product soak in. Then I follow up with the Madagascar centella ampoule. This stuff is non scented and must be milk from the heavens because oh my goodness. I thought my face was glowing before using this but after? I look like I was kissed by the morning dew. Seriously face has never looked so healthy. It's soft, it's glowing, I'm very pleased.My takeaway from using these products is this: give them some time, but for me it didn't take long! I've been using these for maybe two weeks now and I no longer have painful redness under my nose and I haven't had a breakout either. My skin is soft and dewy and wonderful which I noticed after just a couple uses. I am also starting to see my pores look a bit smaller. I'm pretty happy with my switch. I hope you will be too!

I'm so just an FYI I only used this 2 times since I just got it!...however I am soooo freaking shocked!!! ??®??®Ok little back story, I have always had acne prone skin, had to go on Acutane when I was younger, it was that bad. I am now an adult abd have the usual adult acne. I have been using Korean skin care stuff for about three months now. Within my new skin care routine I was using a korean cleansing balm as my 2 step routine for washing...BUT!!! I did not see what I saw with this Cleansing oil ( i should have tanepictures! ?§¶‚?ç‚??Ô∏è) ...now mind you I have watched like a dozen or so cleansing videos and I kept seeing all these little things come out of the people skin, like the little sebum looking things. AND HOLY MOLY THEY WEREN'T KIDDING!!! The crap that came out of my skin yesterday and today...??±??±Lord above, I honestly thought I was loosing my mind!So the texture is not as thick as the balm obviously, but I actually love that! No scent, and light weight. Skin feels soft after, emmolcifies nicely too.So yes I woukd recomend!

I have sensitive combination (oily and dry) skin. If I use a lot of normal cleansers it either stirs up my acne or rosacea or makes my skin dry. This cleanser is oil based and so gentle I can use it twice a day and my skin is glowing. I‚??ve been using this in combination with moisturizer and castor oil at night, and I have had people compliment my skin. I have less than half of my bottle left after about a month, and I may just reorder today so I don‚??t run out without having more. That‚??s how you know you love a product - when you start worrying about running out!

I bought this because of all the reviews saying you can actually see your blackheads , etc after using this, but I haven't seen anything. I use it for about 5 mins in circular motions and then add a little water to create a slight foam (not very foamy) as per instructions online. Then i wash off and cleanse my face with my regular face wash. My face does feel cleaner. I did get one large zit after the first time I used it but it could've been my face being extra clean and just reacting.

I got this product to add to my skincare routine to get rid of the subconscious filaments on my nose that I have tried to get rid of for years. Upon first use I can see the sebum bits on my finger tips. I love this DOWN!!! If I could use this everyday I would but recommend use only twice a week. After the first 2 uses I can see a dramatic change in the texture of my nose it‚??s so smooth.

I've used like a third of the bottle by now, and it's great for taking off makeup.For taking off sebum it works after a good 2 minutes of rubbing and has a good clean sweet mint smell.Does not take off all blackheads which is why people probably also get the ""ANUA Heartleaf Quercetinol Pore Deep Cleansing Foam, Facial Cleanser, for Double Cleansing, BHA, Hyaluronic Acid, Glycerin, Face Wash, Blackhead Remover, Korean Skincare"", I would too the next time I order off amazon.The label however gradually starts coming off due to shower condensation.

I was hopeful that this would melt the sebaceous filaments right out of my nose, which it unfortunately didn't like how some TikTok videos describe. It visibly shrinks them though which is about just as good, and is great for my combination skin. It doesn't dry me out, and doesn't leave me oily. It might still melt blackheads for others though, so i'd say it's worth a shot!

I have a lot of junk in my pores on more nose up to between my eyebrows and I've tried a lot to get rid of it. So far, this is one of the few things the actually works! You can feel the gunk being worked out of your skin and see it on your finger tips afterwards, just make sure to massage HEAVILY into dry skin. Really massage it in there.I have sensitive, dry, reactive skin, and this hasn't broken me out. I follow up with an exfoliating toner, and I am slowly getting rid of the ew.

I started out using this daily, which proved to be a bit too much for my skin. I started doing it 2-3 times a week and have seen better results. Super hydrating and relaxing to massage into your face. The fragrance isn‚??t too strong, and smells more medicinal which I enjoy. As for clearing pores, I‚??ve had better luck with other products BUT this one is the most gentle and I feel has definitely shrunk my pore size some!

My personal experiences with this product is only according to my own face, it won‚??t apply to everyone else‚??s. But to me, I have extremely sensitive oily acne prone skin. I repurchase this as a second bottom but I don‚??t really like it. It kind of burns my skin, I don‚??t know why?? But it‚??s just my skin. Blurs my eyeball out every time I use it but it really doesn‚??t clean out the oil and the blackhead on my disgusting nose ??≠. I would recommend but not for sensitive girly

This is my first time using Korean beauty products. I had a skincare routine using mostly Cerave and other drugstore products. I knew I needed to find something different when my skin continued to break out and I had no healthy glow. So I decided to take a chance on Anua.First of all, I've never had a problem with my skin not being soft. My main problems are continuous breakouts on my forehead and chin area as well as redness under my nose and dull looking skin. I start my routine with this pore cleansing oil. I was skeptical at first because...oil? On my skin? But it smelled so good that I decided to give it a shot. I use just one pump and I massage it on my face for a good couple minutes. After using this for a couple days I did notice my skin was softer and starting to look healthier, but I new I was still missing something. So back to Amazon I went and I got the Anua pore cleansing foam.After using the pore oil, I rinse and follow up with the Anua pore deep cleansing foam, which also smells nice and clean. I lather it up and massage it on my face while paying special attention to my problem areas. After rinsing and patting my face dry, I can already see such a difference with my skin. After a few uses I was getting some glow back and the redness was fading.I decided to add more Korean products to my skincare routine and since Anua, I have also added BHA exfoliating toner  pads and Madagascar centella ampoule. The BHA pads I use directly after the Anua pore cleansing foam. They have a softer side and a rough side for when you need some extra scrubbing. They smell like tea tree oil, which I don't have a problem with but some people do. After using these I pat my face to let the product soak in. Then I follow up with the Madagascar centella ampoule. This stuff is non scented and must be milk from the heavens because oh my goodness. I thought my face was glowing before using this but after? I look like I was kissed by the morning dew. Seriously face has never looked so healthy. It's soft, it's glowing, I'm very pleased.My takeaway from using these products is this: give them some time, but for me it didn't take long! I've been using these for maybe two weeks now and I no longer have painful redness under my nose and I haven't had a breakout either. My skin is soft and dewy and wonderful which I noticed after just a couple uses. I am also starting to see my pores look a bit smaller. I'm pretty happy with my switch. I hope you will be too!

I'm so just an FYI I only used this 2 times since I just got it!...however I am soooo freaking shocked!!! ??®??®Ok little back story, I have always had acne prone skin, had to go on Acutane when I was younger, it was that bad. I am now an adult abd have the usual adult acne. I have been using Korean skin care stuff for about three months now. Within my new skin care routine I was using a korean cleansing balm as my 2 step routine for washing...BUT!!! I did not see what I saw with this Cleansing oil ( i should have tanepictures! ?§¶‚?ç‚??Ô∏è) ...now mind you I have watched like a dozen or so cleansing videos and I kept seeing all these little things come out of the people skin, like the little sebum looking things. AND HOLY MOLY THEY WEREN'T KIDDING!!! The crap that came out of my skin yesterday and today...??±??±Lord above, I honestly thought I was loosing my mind!So the texture is not as thick as the balm obviously, but I actually love that!

Well and truly obsessed with this balm. The stick is smaller than I thought but a little bit goes a long way, and it‚??s very easy to use. I love to put it on before bed, as my night time moisturizer. My skin feels so great in the morning! It does feel a little greasy as it‚??s soaking into your skin (which is why I use it at night and not in the morning), but once it‚??s all absorbed it is fantastic. I had a couple of lines (can‚??t quite be called wrinkles) beginning on my forehead, and this helped make them become less noticeable to myself. The smell is nice and neutral, nothing that would be potent or bothersome. Would 1000/10 buy again!

As a fan of Korean beauty products, I've always been intrigued by their unique offerings, and this one is no exception. With its impressive SPF50, it not only offers excellent sun protection but also stands out for its ability to prevent premature aging and skin damage. I am a redhead, and its a BIG deal for me!One of the standout features of this balm is its convenience. The stick applicator, a practical and easy-to-use design, is perfect for on-the-go use. What's more, I have an oily skin and stick doesn't leave a sticky residue. The balm itself is incredibly moisturizing, leaving my skin and my lips feeling plump and hydrated.But the benefits continue beyond there. The balm also has a skin-brightening effect, giving my complexion a healthy, even tone. It's a perfect companion for sunny days, with a light, pleasant scent for hours.

I LOVE that this gives a soft dewy glow. It has a pleasant rosy smell to me. It does feel a bit sticky on my skin, but I only apply it to just on top of my cheekbones and if my collarbone is exposed. Once it has absorbed into the skin it feels soft and hydrated. Definitely will buy again!I wanted to come back several months later to add more to my review. The product is a good value for the money as it lasts quite a long time. I still have my original purchase. As I said before, I add it like a highlighter to add a bit of shine at the top of my cheekbones and collarbone. It is glossy and wet looking at first, but once the skin absorbs it in there is an effect of a glow from within. I've found when younger (gen x) we were pushed to make our oily teen skin look matte to appear more mature, but now that we are this recreates that youthful luminosity to the skin precisely where it is applied. I've also put this under my eyes and noticed a reduction in puffiness, but definitely apply it a bit before you need it to give it time to absorb.  I get compliments on my skin almost every time I wear it.

AQUA BALM:I already have the multi balm so i decided to try the aqua balm in hopes to pack lighter for an upcoming camping trip. The texture is less greasy(not vaseline greasy but a little bit greasy) than the multi balm and leaves a powdery feel. It leaves no white cast and helps with hyperpigmentation. I like this product, I see myself using it when I'm out working or going to class. This brand is reliable so the price is no concern. The price is up there with brands sold at ulta and sephora. The balm will definitely last you a long time.KISSTIN BALM:I also purchased this one because it can simplify my makeup routine. If I want a little something but not have to pull out my makeup bag then I'll reach for this. For my skin tone it looks like I've been sweating so for the summer I use this only on the lips and during the winter and spring I'll use it on my cheeks. This will probably last longer than the aqua balm since you're using significantly less as the aqua balm is sunscreen and the multi balm is a moisturizer balm.Highly recommend if you're looking for something reliable as your first korean skincare product. Korean skincare never fails to show results. With proper use and time you'll see results come. I look forward to the future with these.

so I‚??m gonna start off by saying this is overall a really good thing to buy. so this product is definitely a dupe of the rare beauty highlighter but you definitely get your moneys worth and it‚??s a pretty good product considering that it‚??s a dupe, but one thing that I didn‚??t like about it is that even though I sealed it pretty tight it‚??s still spilled over my make up bag and it was a pain to clean up but other than that I feel like I recommend it and I hope you enjoy:-)

My daughter wanted the rare beauty liquid highlighter for her birthday. We went to the store numerous times. She tried it every single time. I just couldn‚??t justify spending almost $40 on a 14 year old for this make up. I found this dupe on Amazon. It is looks exactly the same. The applicator even is heart shaped on the bottom. The color is exact and consistency is exact. It wears exact as well. The dupe of the highlighter is next to the rare beauty blush on the left. I swatched on my hand but that picture does not do it Justice. ONLY DIFFERENCE IS IT DOES NOT SAY RARE BEAUTY. I recommend this to EVERYONE!

This highlighter has a really pretty glow and definitely could have been a keeper. However, I received these highlighters less than half full and very clumpy, almost used looking wands. I bought 3. As soon as I pulled the wand out, I could see the bottom of the bottles. Move around the wand and large empty spots on the inside walls of the bottle appeared as if the bottle was close to empty. :( I only swatched on my hand since the half full containers left me concerned about it's use.  I would have loved to keep them. They seem like they would be a good highlighter. Was excited about them being waterproof too.

This is a very lightweight liquid highlighter. I love it! I use it on the days I do a full face of makeup and I put it all over my face after my moisturizer and before I put on my foundation. It gives a natural glow. I have used it on top of my foundation too and it looks really nice as well! Would definitely recommend! If you‚??re looking for something that‚??s super vibrant and bright this might not be for you because it blends in very nicely and can look subtle.

I have been using Cerave products for decades and they have helped me manage my various skin conditions: dry skin, sensitive skin, keratosis pilaris, and occasional breakouts. They are easy to find, effective, and fit in my budget.  Having said that, everyone's skin, preferences, and budget are different, so as a point of reference, I am a middle-aged woman who uses Retin-A which causes my skin to be sensitive and can be drying. I learned about double cleansing from Dr. Dray, a board-certified dermatologist, who has her own YouTube channel. I am a fanatic about sunscreen, and some types of sunscreen are harder to remove than others. The double cleanse method of using an oil-based cleanser followed by a mild cleanser makes sure all sunscreen, dirt, oil, and makeup are removed in a gentle, non-drying way. I have used different cleansing oils and there is one that I still buy and use regularly, but here's what I appreciate about Cerave Cleansing Balm:It's solid at room temperature, so it will travel well and not potentially cause a mess like an oil could.It's a small container (1.3 oz) perfect for travel and the container can be washed and reused when empty.A little goes a long way; it should last a long time if using the amount indicated - a pearl-sized amount.No irritating ingredients, fragrance, or essential oils.Has a very mild scent that does not linger and I do not find off-putting at all.Removes my stubborn sunscreen without scrubbing, irritation, or stripping all moisture.Rinses off easily without leaving a residue.Leaves my skin moisturized but not at all sticky, oily, or greasy.I follow up with the Cerave Hydrating Facial Cleanser and my skin feels plump and moisturized even before I put on any moisturizer.For people who say they thought the jar would be bigger, the amount of product (1.3 oz) is listed in the very title of the product and in the description, and the price gives the breakdown per ounce, so neither Amazon nor Cerave were trying to conceal the size. For people who say it irritated their eyes, the description clearly states, ""Avoid direct contact with eyes. If contact occurs, rinse thoroughly with water."" I know most of us don't have a lot of extra time, but it does pay to slow down and read a bit more closely. Currently the price has dropped to $9.47 from $13.99 which is $4.52 cheaper and a good deal for a quality product. I will definitely buy it again and again - especially at the lower price - and enjoy the results. Good luck!Update: This arrived on August 22nd and I used it almost every night. I used more than a pearl-sized amount  each time and it lasted until November 5th, so more than two months with every day use.

I am such a big fan of this cleansing balm! I bought this because I wear eyeliner and waterproof mascara almost daily and I was finding that I would have to wash my face 2-3 times with face wash in order to get the eye makeup off. This product works wonders on my makeup! It takes it right off without issue.The best part- it doesn't irritate my eyes! I usually get a bit in my eyes but it doesn't hurt at all. The only way I can tell that I got it in my eyes is because my eyesight is a little bit blurry between when I use this balm and when I wash with regular face wash (the face wash & rinsing with water clears my eye sight).One callout is that it works best if your face and hands are dry. I instinctively wet my face the first time I used it and it didn't work as well so I was skeptical. Once I did it on my dry skin then it worked like a charm. The product is silky enough so that it isn't irritating at all on dry skin. It actually feels kind of good and soothing.

I was looking for a more oily makeup remover due to the need to remove waterproof makeup and provide a more moisturizing treatment for my aging skin (46 years young). I used it by rubbing it into my skin, especially around the eye area, and then used a warm microfiber cloth to wipe it off. I should mention that I have very sensitive skin, particularly around the eyes. My skin tolerated this product well, and I did not experience any discomfort or reaction (especially in the eye region).The product works AMAZINGLY; I love how it removes all makeup and moisturizes my skin in the process. However, the smell is a bit off-putting. It has an artificial and chemical scent that I find unpleasant. Despite this, I will continue using it, especially during travel, because it is convenient and I prefer it to makeup-removing towels or tissues. I would recommend it because it works, but if you are sensitive to smells, I would advise caution.

I skipped by this product at first because a few reviews said it left an oily feel. It doesn‚??t. When you rinse with water the product emulsifies and rinses clean.I was looking for something gentle that would remove mascara and eyeliner. For years I‚??d used makeup wipes and they were fine, until they weren‚??t. My eyelids were becoming sensitive, dry, and irritated. I was unsure why, but started trying new makeup removers. None seemed to remove it without a lot of effort which made the irritation worse. I started using Cetaphil Hydrating Eye Gel-Cream to heal my eyelids, and it works great. But, couldn‚??t find a remover for months until I tried this Cera Ve balm. Here‚??s how I use it. Apply about a pea size blob on a super soft microfiber cloth. Rub it in to a quarter-sized circle. Gently wipe the mascara and eyeliner off. For me, it takes a minute per eye. Then I take another small blob, apply it to my forehead and cheeks with my fingers (no cloth), massage it into my entire face, then rinse well with water. Ta-Da! Clean skin that feels great! If I get any product in my eyes, I wipe my lower eyelids with a Q-tip from outer to inner corner. Then apply my favorite skincare. I love it! But, you need to try it out and figure your best application method depending on your makeup and skin needs. Forgot to mention, it has no odor. Great product!

I struggle to remove mascara at the end of the day, and I really can't afford brands like the Clinique balm. This is not only affordable, but it actually works. Yes, it's a small container, but I only needed a tiny amount of balm, so I can see this lasting me a long time. I gently rubbed it into my lashes, and SO MUCH mascara came off within seconds. I cleaned away the excess with a little micellar water on a cotton pad. No constant rubbing of my eyes. No mascara residue under my eyes the next day. It doesn't have a strong scent and it's such gentle product. I'm so pleased and will definitely buy again.

I have been using Cerave products for decades and they have helped me manage my various skin conditions: dry skin, sensitive skin, keratosis pilaris, and occasional breakouts. They are easy to find, effective, and fit in my budget.  Having said that, everyone's skin, preferences, and budget are different, so as a point of reference, I am a middle-aged woman who uses Retin-A which causes my skin to be sensitive and can be drying.

There needs to be an option for NO star! This product has ZERO stars from me! I was so excited to get new makeup! I opened it immediately! To my surprise it was very small the picture was a bit misleading but that I could have overlooked. I touched the eyeshadows and they were so hard I tried with a Q-tip to see color- nothing!  I guess I could have scraped the top to get some off to see the colors but I had opened a lipstick and it as well was so hard would not just have glided over your hand didn't appear to be moist or even usable at all. I was looking at each product that was there and if I‚??m honest I got to wondering ‚??is this safe‚?ù? I guess you already know by now I sent it straight back! I did read a few reviews and it boggles my mind that some people liked it SO much and then mine was not usable and play-like almost ???. I am also a little disappointed that Amazon would allow such things to be sold under their empire but ?§∑‚?ç‚??Ô∏è what do I know. Would NOT  Recommend! I do not like leaving bad reviews however I rely so much on them I felt I should say something because I truly feel this product was not usable and or safe-just my honest opinion.

The chapstick and the nude lip gloss were both kind of gritty feeling on my lips. Another thing I don''t like is that the lip glosses stain your lips a little bit and I know the eyebrow stuff is waterproof but like I  used two kinds of makeup remover to get it off . I used makeup wipes and makeup melting balm neither got it off. I had to use rubbing alchol to get it off !!! Everything else is good though some of the concealer kind of had a pinkish shade to them though . I love the concealer stick it matched pretty well to my skin tone and my skin tone is fair to beige . All the other stuff was really good . I love the eyeshadow .

This is a complete makeup kit, especially for novices like me.This kit is great for travel, since they are smaller in size but has everything. I travel often and I always feel like I should take all my cosmetics just in case I have a special occasion or outing, but that takes up a lot of room. I recently took this bag/kit, (not by choice but because I was running late for my travel and it was all I grabbed before leaving), and came to find that it had all I needed. Makeup for the day and evening or outing.It comes with everything needed to achieve a complete look.The color options of the shadow palette and the lipsticks/lip glosses are great, with a variety of colors/shades to suit all occasions.The lipsticks are creamy and don't dry my lips.The mascara has a small brush, which I love, and it does not cause allergies as some others do.The foundation is not my shade but I use it on some areas to highlight.The brushes are soft and do not lose any bristles when applying makeup.The products are great on my skin and the kit comes with everything needed and many color options.Overall, this is a good, complete kit that in my opinion is priced accordingly.

This lip stuff is the bomb! The applicator is nice & thick so you get a good coating in just 1 or 2 swipes! It makes my lips feel refreshed & hydrated while leaving them with a light glossy shine. Unlike some, it isn't sticky at all, which I especially like. I first heard about it & learned of it from the Today Show. They raved about it, so I thought I'd give it a try! So glad that I did! I love it.

I've only had this lip gloss for five days and you would have to pry it away from my cold, dead hands. I am IN LOVE with this gloss! It's not sticky at all, has a very mild smell (not an unpleasant one!), and the color is vibrant and exactly like the photos after just one coat. My lips don't feel dry after wearing this too - they feel so soft and hydrated! Literally don't see myself using any other lip gloss ever again, I can't wait to buy more of these in other colors now lol

It really nice! It appears to be so far since I've been trying it out to be really nice and it looks nice on me what I can see. It smells nice. Doesn't seem to have any funky weird smell, which is nice. I'm not sure what to take of the taste it your tongue does come contact to it it's not a nasty taste it does give like as it says the name oil kind of taste oily but. But it's not a bad one but it feels a bit different taste a bit different. When you're wearing it and drinking eating something you're consuming it meets contact with it you're going to taste it and it's not a terrible taste, nothing funky, which is nice. You can definitely feel it on your lips it's not super weighing down but if you apply it like I do I do at least two three coats and it has some weight to it but it's a smooth not super heavy not feathery light I guess but I don't quite know how to explain it a weight knowing that it's there but not a weighing down weight. It doesn't feel over oily or gooey, which is nice. It does look kind of gooey and sticky as you get it out just remember to shake it I forget to do that. So far for me it's been nice I don't know it's not terrible but I'm still unsure how I feel about it I like it but it's just kind of a more oily lip gloss, instead of a creamy like lip gloss more of what I'm used to and I really like so I still like it but it's feels kind of different weird than my usual what I like to wear. I got it on sale so for me it was definitely worth the money. All this makeup stuff's kind of pricey for me I just wear it for special occasions or just feel like perking myself up. Maybe doing a little sprucing myself a bit up I guess you could say. It's not terrible I like it but I'm used to it ignore creamy or gloss it is like it says in the name the more oily but not like oily watery oily there is some more thickness to it which I like. The price for it is not terrible but it's a little bit more pricey for my liking for what I got it for on sale I definitely would like to get it again but I have to wait until I have it but if it comes on sale again I would definitely purchase at least two or three of them!

This is a GREAT lip product, reminds me of Rare Beauty but less dry. This one WORKS, left my lips super soft & I like the pink undertone. I wanted to try a different shade, but went with this one and I absolutely love it! It‚??s a good travel size, fits in your bag & the scent smells of watermelon! Which is a plus. The price point is all too worth it! Definitely recommend, and there is a good amount of product in here that will last I‚??m sure a very long time! It is NOT sticky! Just glides on smooth! So happy with my purchase! Thank you Amazon, this one was hard to track down. None of my nearby stores had it!

This product is a 10/10 for me! I use it everyday , leaves your lips , soft , glossy and it‚??s supper pretty! It has a hint of tint to it. It‚??s not sticky and it moisturized your lips.

This NYX lip oil is a fantastic find! It's super moisturizing, just like the Fenty lip oil, but at a much more affordable price.  The high shine finish is gorgeous and leaves my lips feeling plump and hydrated.  The tint adds a nice bit of color, and it's become a staple I always carry in my purse for easy touch-ups throughout the day.

These lip oils have become my go to for every day & even going out. I love the sheer pigment & how it gives you a subtle yet juicy lip. The applicator is pretty big but it is comfortable. I love how affordable these are since i tend to misplace my lip products. It glides on smooth & lasts a decent amount of time. Not sticky & it feels hydrating on the lips. The only thing i dont like is the smell/taste of these. It goes away in a short while but still unpleasant imo. Other than that the color payoff is great for a lip oil & they are very wearable. Would recommend!

After seeing a lot of reviews decided to give this a try!  Purchased Missed Call shade.  This lip oil is a game changer!  Goes on smooth and silky and gives just a hint of color.  Stays on for a long time.  Great size to throw in your bag.  Will get other colors

Wow! I am OBSESSED! I came back to buy 2 more to have everywhere. I actually like this more than the name brand Black honey because they only have a sticky version and one that your lips always have to be super smooth and it does not last long. This color is universal and looks amazing on fair skin.  It is a very unique color. Very few other companies have successfully pulled off a good dupe. It is like a very deep midnight plum.  The ""chocolate"" is more a balance to the purple than a true brown. My husband makes a comment every single time I wear this. I have very fair skin. I highly recommend this. I hope they never stop making it.

This lip stuff is the bomb! The applicator is nice & thick so you get a good coating in just 1 or 2 swipes! It makes my lips feel refreshed & hydrated while leaving them with a light glossy shine. Unlike some, it isn't sticky at all, which I especially like. I first heard about it & learned of it from the Today Show. They raved about it, so I thought I'd give it a try! So glad that I did! I love it.

I've only had this lip gloss for five days and you would have to pry it away from my cold, dead hands. I am IN LOVE with this gloss! It's not sticky at all, has a very mild smell (not an unpleasant one!), and the color is vibrant and exactly like the photos after just one coat. My lips don't feel dry after wearing this too - they feel so soft and hydrated! Literally don't see myself using any other lip gloss ever again, I can't wait to buy more of these in other colors now lol

I got this makeup organizer for my dorm room desk when I was going to be a freshman in college, and I am heading into my junior year in the fall, and I have no complaints about this organizer. It has two fairly sized drawers which I put my blush, bronzer, and highlight pallets in. One big drawer that I put my extra contact cases in, my actual glasses case in, more makeup pallets and some hair ties. Up front there are 3 medium sized containers, and in the back there are 3 large sized containers, and to the side there is a flat space for like perfume, or Aquaphor tubs. Overall I am really impressed with this organizer. Nothing has broke on it, it's super easy to clean, has a surprising amount of space and holds a lot. It's also easy to transport with your makeup and other things still in it.

If you are a diligent face washer, you NEED these. They are spa-quality, clean, one-use sponges. Once the sponge is wet, it's soft and not abrasive or irritating. Perfect for a good, clean face wash minus the bacteria-filled washcloths we've been using for 100 years. Great price. Get them!

I recently purchased the GAINWELL 50-Colored Natural Compressed Facial Sponges and I am absolutely thrilled with them! These sponges are a game changer for my daily skincare routine. Each sponge is wonderfully soft and gentle on the skin, making them ideal for facial cleansing without any irritation.What I love most about these sponges is how effectively they work to remove makeup and cleanse the skin deeply. They lather up beautifully with just a small amount of cleanser, which helps in conserving my skincare products. The variety of colors in the pack is not only fun but also practical, allowing me to color-code sponges for different uses or family members.Another major plus is their eco-friendliness and reusability. After use, they rinse out easily and dry quickly, maintaining their shape and texture even after multiple uses. This not only ensures that I am making an environmentally friendly choice but also offers great value for money.Given their quality, effectiveness, and price point, I definitely plan to repurchase these sponges and would recommend them to anyone looking for an efficient, sustainable option for facial cleansing. The GAINWELL sponges have truly exceeded my expectations and have become a staple in my beauty regime!

I have been using this for a few years, and I love it!  I hate the feeling of makeup on my face, but as I get older, I need something to even out my skin tone.  This does that without feeling heavy - I use this in place of foundation.  However, the last few tubes I have bought - the pump stops working!  I have returned them a couple of times, but it is a pain in the rear to keep doing that.  So - now I am trying to find something like this because I am tired of spending $60 on something that stops working.

The set is really cute and did what it needs to do. Just recently started using it so it‚??s still just shredding lint so much. Other than that it‚??s worth the price.

I bought this as a gift she loves it. It‚??s washable and the color is very vibrant and doesn‚??t fade. It‚??s comfortable for her and not too tight. It‚??s very elastic and held up the test of time. Great over all!!

Decent for the price. If you have a larger head the elastic headband may be uncomfortable. I have a very small head and it is tight in me.

Cute, the right color, and they are very soft. I did not use these as I gifted them in a prize basket so I am not sure about absorbency, but the person who received them, loved it. Very stretchy so I don't think fit would be an issue for most. Great little gift, but you can buy these on shein or temu for cheaper, just have to wait a little longer.

I bought this because my boyfriend is making a movie about an influencer so I looked up what they use constantly and this popped up. So far It has just ended up as personal use since the movie hasn't been made yet. I love it and it works great. Super happy to have the wrist bands because I always end up with water down my arms without it.

The wrist bands are perfect. Kept water off of me and off my floor.

I loved loved loved the color in the photos but didn't think to actually estimate what the color was going to be. It's a little bit more yellow than I thought it was going to be. Great product in general though!

This little guy is a game changer.I have lots of zoom work meetings and for whatever reason, the software accentuates dark spots, acne scars, and raccoon eyes worse than in real life.This concealer has been helpful in boosting my confidence - a little goes a long way - and has simultaneously fought breakouts.I have very sensitive skin and it‚??s worked very well. The only blending issues I get are when I accidentally add a little too much.I do have to moisturize before adding, otherwise it can slightly dry my skin out. And then you get flaky texture obviously sitting on on your skin.

I am completely blown away by this concealer.  First of all, thank you Neutrogena for producing a yellow-based concealer.  This matches my complexion perfectly (I purchased medium 15).  I have tried a few concealers including MAC, which were not skin friendly - at least for me.  Then I've been using Murad's conealer for some time.  It is very good and stays on all day with a matte finish under powder.  However, the shades have pink undertones and it doesn't match my face like the Neutrogena concealer.  This one outshines Murad -  a BIG surprise given the relatively cheap price.  It also glides on smoother and covers blemishes and imperfections very well.  Moreover, even though it conceals so well, it is more lightweight than the Murad concealer.Even better, it blends so well that you do not necessarily need foundation.  I use it with Mario Badescu's Special Healing powder, topped with Maybelline Fit Me powder.  I have not tried the Neutrogena mineral powder as these mineral powders do not agree with my skin (despite their popularity).  I would consider the Healthy Skin powder be Neutrogena; but I fell in love with Fit Me.  It really does ""fit"" your complexion perfectly!  Anyway, I have also invested in one of the Neutrogena Skin Clearing foundation.  It is also the bomb!  Only use it when going out on the town though and maintain the abovementioned regime for day wear.It should definitely be produced in a wider range of shades though to cater to darker skin tones.  It's a great product and should be suitable for all of us ladies.  :o)Cheers

The texture and application of the product was fine. However, the colors offered did not work for my skin tone. If you have cool peach undertones the colors  may work for you.  I have light olive skin with yellow undertones and neither the light or medium worked for me. The other color offered looked too dark. I had to throw the products away. But I did eventually find almay offers colors in a blemish concealer that do work for my skin tone.

Here is what I have learned from using this medicated concealer.  It is not for everyone as it does have salicylic acid 0.05% in it which is what helps to clear the acne.  However, that is not why I tried it.  I have a problem with milia on my face, especially the nose and chin areas.  If you are not familiar with milia, it is small hard cystic like round ""things"" right below the surface of the skin.  Unlike acne or blackheads, they cannot be squeezed to get the contents out.  There is a tool designed to just nick the skin at the site of the milia and extract it.  This medicated concealer can be used then in a small amount to cover the area.  If all the milia have not surfaced, this concealer will ""draw"" them to the surface for gentle removal.  From what I understand, good exfoliation of your face will keep this condition managed.  While all people certainly do not have this problem, I unfortunately do.  So my experience is with this only.  I also have found that this concealer can be very drying and will cause peeling of the skin since I do use it 2-3 times a day right now.  But, I don't mind because I sort of need that action to get rid of the milia.  Otherwise, if you experience drying or peeling of your skin, cut back to once a day or every other day.  Also, as some have stated, it does not work that well for under foundation concealer as it can be very dry and will show through your foundation.  Bottom line, if you need a medication for acne or milia, this works great, and it serves as a concealer while it is doing its job.  Once healed, I will most likely switch to another concealer without this ingredient in it. I hope this has been helpful.

Great product. It works very well‚?¶ but, packaging  sucks. Each time ‚?¶ I have about 1/6 of product left in the bottled container. Nothing you can do to pump the remainder out. You can knock it, shake it , and bang it. Product will not pump out. You can not unscrew it, and if you try to break it, you will get glass in the product. That‚??s dangerous and I advise against it.  For $20 plus tax for such a small bottle, we should be able to get it all. For this reason, and only this reason‚?¶ until packaging is change to a plastic squeeze container, I will try other easily accessible products that give me All my primer .

The grip is amazing I‚??m more so silicone makeup so since this is water based in order to use i would have to let it rest for a minute but it still interacted well with my silicone products.

Still useable with silicone tho because it‚??s just that good .

A very good primer if your skin isn‚??t sensitive. Gives a flawless finish to your foundation, and can even be used for under-eye concealer and eyeshadow.However, this gave me cystic pimples and I only used it a couple of times. I will still be using for eye makeup though!

Y‚??all, I wanted to love this product so badly, but after having tried it, I got the worst breakout. First off, I applied the hydro- primer and waited for it to fully dry before applying my moisturizing treatment. Because of the rave-reviews, and reading how this would really help hydrate and leave skin with a dewy look, I was all in. I even purchased the biggest size available, but gosh, what a waste of money. For me, it left my dry skin looking caked with makeup once it set. And the ‚??dewy look‚?ù only made me feel like my foundation was not providing me the coverage I normally have, I felt like it took me having to apply more foundation on top of this, thus not giving me the true primer that I was hoping for. I suggest that if you really want to try the hype, buy the smallest size, actually see if it works for you. I figured I‚??d be saving money by buying the larger size, since I would use it daily, but on my second day, I was having breakouts, and felt like a teen again in my thirties! It just didn‚??t work for me at all and sadly, into the trash it goes!
"

I like it but for the price there are others out there that work just as well. My fault for not looking at the amount in the bottle and just never imagining the size being so small. It‚??s like a sample size for $20 bucks. That‚??s just crazy to me. I‚??ve actually gotten sample products bigger than this for free!! I‚??ll never buy it again for this reason only because I liked how it worked just not good enough to pay that price. I‚??ve used Ulta brand and it works just as good for $5. And you get more.
"

The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because you get such a small amount for such a high price. I wish I could afford to purchase this regularly but honestly I think the ELF brand makes a primer that‚??s very similar and a quarter of the price. I wish some of these higher end brands would make their products more affordable for everyone; if they did, I‚??d purchase those products all the time!

I'm super excited to report this works.  I'm an oily skinned woman in my early 40's who wears minimal make up daily, but I've had to rely on blotting my face with either blotting sheets or tissue 2 times a day to look fresh.  I slowly rolled the applicator all over my face after dinner and I couldn't believe how good of a job this did to remove the shine on my skin.  Don't get me wrong, it's not a miracle worker where I looked like I had just applied fresh makeup, but it did a great job.  I was noticeably less shiny with a semi-matte looking finish. I  did notice very slight transferring of my make up in the oiliest areas of my face (nose & forehead), but it was minor and could easily be touched up.  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone with oily skin and I love how sustainable, compact, and cost effective the item is.  I will be buying a couple more of these to stash at work and in my purse.  Glad I found this!
"

Tried it out as soon as it arrived.  It's works.  I hate carrying around blotters just because you have to use multiple and then you just hold on to the nasty little balls of oil until you find a trash can.  On top of that the cardboard packaging just never holds up.  I tried the roller as soon as I got it.  Amazing.  I have also carried around a Bare Minerals compact of their translucent powder.  The powder is great but the consistency is so soft and fine that the pan got annihilated just from being jostled around and covered my purse with powder.  Was super happy about that.  This roller is compact and simple.  Not sure how well it will do after months of use, but I'm imagining I can easily clean this.  Will update in the future.  Long story short I love it so far!

Technically, it does what it's supposed to do but I had to roll it on my face many times for it to be effective. I was under the impression it'd be a lot quicker.

This is magic in a rollerball.  You roll it on your face and the oil wisps away.  Perfect for that midday oil buildup.  There is no chemicals, just a roller ball that takes the grease away.
