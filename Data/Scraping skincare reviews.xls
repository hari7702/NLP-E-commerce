I am a teenager who is now making my own money, so I now buy my own things. I personally have grown a bit stingy with my money and am not always sure what to buy. I thought making a review would help some others like myself.1: I have easily irritable skin (I always somehow see an allergic reaction to the skin products I usually use/get.) — and I get acne from the sports I do. These products do not make my skin burn or anything of the sort, as well as my acne goes away quickly after using this (-But I do not have severe acne, a few bumps and pimples here and there, mostly on the forehead.) It’s always an easy application, my skin is soft afterwards, and at most my skin gets a little pink after putting it on but instantly goes back away.2: What I have seen in my products I have received- they don’t fill the container/containers up fully. I have seen this mostly in the face cream. It doesn’t bother me too much, but it is a bit unsatisfactory knowing I could have had more product and I know that would turn some other people off.3: From other reviews I have read, some people are complaining about the smell of a product/the products. The smell they are probably talking about is the smell of the daily cleanser. (I have not smelled anything badly from any of the other products) - The smell of the daily cleanser smells like a soapy / dish soap kind of smell. The smell really goes away fast for me and doesn’t bother me so much, but I do understand how it could turn some other people off.4: The size of the products aren’t very surprising to me. It’s big enough for testers - (as seen in photos). It gives you a good taste of what the products have in store for you. I’ve had these products for about a week now and I have been liking them for the price. (They are not gone in a week as long as you use the right amount of product according to the instructions on the back of the bottle/containers.)5: The product I REALLY like from this set alone is the makeup melting cleansing balm. As seen on the instructions on the back of the container, this is used for dry skin. (I personally get dry skin around my mouth and on the top of my nose bridge- above my mouth, beside my mouth, etc.) this helped A LOT. Not even exaggerating, I swear! The product didn’t make my skin feel stiff or burn after using.

My mom and I both have dry skin. She has some full size products which I used and wanted to try a wider range. I love how these products feel. Many moisturizers I've tried left my face feeling heavy. I agree that the products are a bit smaller than pictured, however, a very small amount goes a long way. I am always frugal about my skin care usage, so I tried about a pencil -sized amount and it was enough for me.

or perfect for samples. I ordered for the moisturizer and though I would order this entire sample/travel set to give it a try. I've been using this for a few weeks now as a primary face cleanser set and I love it. The under eye cream and serum do a great job for overnight repair. The moisturizer helps my dry skin so much and leaves it soft each time. The makeup remove balm IS AMAZING. I'm definitely buying this as a full product. The face wash is gentle and smells heavenly. The entire set is great. It has helped with my dry skin and this Arizona summer ""dry heat""

I was very surprised by the quality of these products.  The smell was pleasant, not overly fragrant.  I have sensitive skin and this did not flare up my skin.  No burning sensation with my sensitive skin.  I have very dry skin and this helped it.  Made my skin feel soft.  Helped with the dryness.  Didnt leave my skin itchy.  Ive used all the products and all seemed good to me.  The cleanser, I used with a silicone face brush.  Good lather.  Cleans makeup and daily diet well.  It doesn't leave your skin oily.  All products absorb well into the skin.  I didn't break out  using these products.  Very impressive.  Will buy again.

I work for Amazon and saw this product while packing and said to myself “I've been looking for a face care routine. Let me give this a shot!” On my break I ordered it! It arrived today and I couldn’t wait to use it! I followed step by step instructions that are on the back of the packaging. And immediately wanted to give this product 5 stars! 5 easy to follow instructions and BAM my face feels amazing!!! I will be purchasing the full size set! Elf is an awesome product try it I’m sure you will love it like I do!!!!

I love this product. Glad I purchased the mini-set because I would never have tried all the products, since I have sensitive skin and don't like wasting money. I plan to buy the full size products as I run out.The moisturizer is great, no skin reaction and works well on my dry and normal skin.The oil really feels like it penetrates deeply. I use it on my dry eczema spots mainly and I don't feel so scaly there anymore.The face wash works great. My skin always feels smooth afterwards.I don't wear makeup often, but the few times I've used the makeup remover, it was different. It's more of a solid/wax type texture, but it definitely removed my eye makeup quickly and it felt better than the stuff with beads and my eyes were not red afterwards, which is rare for me.

After reading some of the reviews that complained about the fragrance, I was a little reluctant try it. But I'm glad I did. This skin care feels so nice on my face. It isn't thick and globby. And my sensitive skin isn't reacting negatively.

I bought the watermelon spray because I like the brand and the watermelon dew drops. I did not like the smell of this spray (cheap bitter artificial watermelon) but the scent does not linger too long. I thought the effect on the skin was good but not 5 star good. I have the d’alba spray and the tatchaspray that I like much better. I’m not sorry I bought it and I use it but truthfully it comes in at 3rd place in my stash if facial mists.

I have loved this product ever since my friend got some in a subscription box of hers once that wasn’t a box that I was receiving; and she saw I loved it so much that she ran out the next day and got me my own. It was my fav gift EVER. I used it all last summer and took it with me everywhere I went for spritzes of refreshment and watermelon smell. Try keeping it in your fridge before going to the pool or wherever. It’s amazing. I loved it so much I was spritzing everyone, much the the dismay of several manly men, but to the joy of several others. (So there is PLENTY of product but I bought several because I like to share things I love.) When I went to buy yet another bottle recently I was so confused to see the watermelon dew drops that had gone viral because I had thought this was their only product prior to that and thought they just changed their formula and bottle or something since that other product kept on popping up when I typed this in. I was so distraught. Luckily I eventually found this beloved product obviously; but not before giving the few drops a try. I bought the sample box with it in it and the full sized bottle of it thinking it must be even more amazing since it went viral and this product didn’t. WRONG. There is nothing impressive about the few drops whatsoever. Should’ve known. Anyhow hashtag this is the real deal product of theirs that DESERVES to go viral. Buy this. You won’t tegret it. And if you do then something is wrong with you and not this amazing product!!! Smell is amazing, light shimmer is amazing, no stickiness, lots of refreshment, wear it with or without makeup, add a spritz of watermelon happiness to your day! I only recommend they do the exact same formula in different scents. ::hint, hint:: I love banana and you never see banana stuff. ;)

This came in and was exactly what I was looking for. My daughter has lots of makeup and skincare products, but not an abundance of storage space. This has allowed her to get all of her products neatly organized, and looks nice in her room. It was easy to assemble, it is very durable, spins easily and holds a lot of product. The pink color is exactly as advertised in the photo. I would definitely buy more of these if I needed them!

When it comes to storage space for your brushes, the brush holder may seem small at first glance, but don't be fooled by its size - it can easily accommodate up to 30 brushes. However, it is worth noting that the brushes may sometimes slide out, which can be a bit inconvenient. On the bright side, the holder is made of plastic, making it incredibly easy to clean and maintain.One of the things that stands out about this makeup organizer is its clear acrylic material, which not only provides a sleek and modern look but also complements a minimalistic aesthetic. In terms of functionality, the holder does its job well and meets the needs of those looking to store their brushes in an organized manner.Putting this makeup organizer together is a breeze, thanks to the clear and simple instructions that come with it. The plastic material used is also quite durable, ensuring that it will last for a long time. Additionally, the lazy Susan feature of the holder allows for smooth and easy rotation, making it a convenient option for accessing your brushes easily.Overall, the makeup holder not only offers practical storage solutions but also adds a touch of style to your space. Its ease of use, durability, and sleek design make it a great choice for anyone looking to keep their brushes/makeup organized and easily accessible.

I’m still going to use it but it just looks cheap with it being broken.OTHER THAN THAT… It was easy to put together. It holds all of my skin care and make up. You can adjust the shelves to the size you need. It rotates well and comes with no slip dots for the bottom.Mine is pretty clear except the very top is a little dusty looking.

Omg this organizer is amazing!!!! I use it for my makeup and it was definitely a lot bigger than I thought it would be but that's good because I save a lot of space on my desk for more of my stuff the only thing that kinda bothers me is where the brushes go they kind of slip around but it's not that big of a deal. And I love how you can change how tall the seperators can be because I have a lot of taller bottles which wouldn't fit in most organizers. I definitely recommend this product!!!

Hopefully the photo shows how much of my vanity items it holds. I like so much! Plus that it rotates! Nothing to dislike as of yet.

I'll be using this for life. It's perfect my skin. I ditched foundation a while ago because I didn't need it. My skin is clear but I still wanted something light so that my powder blush would set right. Something that was not tacky or greasy. This is it. I like the way it feels and it looks great. It wasn't dry or oily. The last product I tried in this category felt tacky and too shiny and it was 3x the price of this. It made my pores look huge. This actually minimized the appearance of my pores. Don't be fooled by the products that are more expensive. This was so reasonably priced and I'm very pleased.

I love this stuff so much. I will either mix it in with my moisturizer or foundation. It gives me that glowy tan look im looking for. Its kinda subtle so you will have to mix equal parts of whatever your using. I got the darkest shade for this reason. The other ones don’t show up as well as the darkest one. I know that the pale one is great if your actually pale and want to look glowy but the dark one is mostly just to achieve a tan look.

I tried this product after reading an advertisement . It truly gives your face a wonderful soft glow. I ha c e rosacea so I need to use a cover base, however, I put a few drops of this on my fingers and  dab this across my cheeks and forehead for a soft, subtle, glow. I carry this in my purse now ft or a quick touch up should it.

I’m a older women with great grand children.I do Use a moisturizer, eye cream,?and lite makeup and I was feeling my face was looking  dry, pasty  and old. ! Lol.I bought this from all the good reviews , but there Allot younger then me!When I first put this on I thought I used a little, but every line, in my face lite up!This is shimmery frosted looking.I did not put  makeup over this  But it was scary looking.I was going to return this.I Gave it a second chance , But Now I just use a little more then a pin head on my fingers and rub it in my cheeks, and use a little blush.  Sometimes a little makeup over this .I like the natural look.My face looks less dry and not pasty.!This feels very moisturizing , or a little greasy!!!This tube will last me a long time!

I really like this product it makes your skin glow!! The only downside is that it is a very small tube. I should check and see if there is a larger size. No problems with breakouts or anything like that. I’ve been using it every day.

I've never been good at or got the hang of doing contour or even bronzer. I've been trying to find a slightly more glam version of my usual natural makeup look for my wedding, but I just suck at and hate the look of bronzer! But my face felt too flat and pale with my base of foundation. This solved my issue! It's the perfect balance of bringing warmth and a little shimmer to my face without the effort of shaping with a brush. It's smooth and easily sits on top of my skin tint or foundation and warms my face back up. A little bit of blush and I'm good to go!

I place this strategically after applying foundation and concealer. It gives a pretty glow, enough of a highlight without looking overdone. It’s a softer highlight than any of the powders I have and I like that. I tried it by itself without foundation and also mixed with foundation, but both ways caused breakouts on my ridiculously sensitive skin. I use L’Oreal Infallible foundation, which doesn’t cause me to break out, and hoped that being from the same cosmetic company, this product wouldn’t either. I like it, but I can live without it when this tube is empty.

I've used this after applying either primer or other foundation or by itself and I absolutely love it by itself or with primer! It give my skin a slightly ""dewy"" look which I love and need as I am 70 years young! I'm sticking with this product!!!

I add the medium shade to my moisturizer everyday! It gives the perfect tinted and shimmer color that gives me a light color. Definitely recommend buying this. I have been wanting to try the new elf drops and other products but I always fall back this product.

After struggling to find a new, light “foundation”, finally, this isn’t!  This product provides moisture, a healthy glow and a hint of color without settling into lines and wrinkles or accentuating them.  It gives skin a youthful glow and just glides on. That said, if you need actual coverage of flaws, you will need to add another product. I use just a touch of cover up on my chin and under eye darkness first, then glide this over my entire face. It works wonderfully!  Don’t change it!

I'll be using this for life. It's perfect my skin. I ditched foundation a while ago because I didn't need it. My skin is clear but I still wanted something light so that my powder blush would set right. Something that was not tacky or greasy. This is it. I like the way it feels and it looks great. It wasn't dry or oily. The last product I tried in this category felt tacky and too shiny and it was 3x the price of this. It made my pores look huge. This actually minimized the appearance of my pores. Don't be fooled by the products that are more expensive. This was so reasonably priced and I'm very pleased.

I love this stuff so much. I will either mix it in with my moisturizer or foundation. It gives me that glowy tan look im looking for. Its kinda subtle so you will have to mix equal parts of whatever your using. I got the darkest shade for this reason. The other ones don’t show up as well as the darkest one. I know that the pale one is great if your actually pale and want to look glowy but the dark one is mostly just to achieve a tan look.

I tried this product after reading an advertisement . It truly gives your face a wonderful soft glow. I ha c e rosacea so I need to use a cover base, however, I put a few drops of this on my fingers and  dab this across my cheeks and forehead for a soft, subtle, glow. I carry this in my purse now ft or a quick touch up should it.

Lol.I bought this from all the good reviews , but there Allot younger then me!When I first put this on I thought I used a little, but every line, in my face lite up!This is shimmery frosted looking.I did not put  makeup over this  But it was scary looking.I was going to return this.I Gave it a second chance , But Now I just use a little more then a pin head on my fingers and rub it in my cheeks, and use a little blush.  Sometimes a little makeup over this .I like the natural look.My face looks less dry and not pasty.!This feels very moisturizing , or a little greasy!!!This tube will last me a long time!

I really like this product it makes your skin glow!! The only downside is that it is a very small tube. I should check and see if there is a larger size. No problems with breakouts or anything like that. I’ve been using it every day.

I've never been good at or got the hang of doing contour or even bronzer. I've been trying to find a slightly more glam version of my usual natural makeup look for my wedding, but I just suck at and hate the look of bronzer! But my face felt too flat and pale with my base of foundation. This solved my issue! It's the perfect balance of bringing warmth and a little shimmer to my face without the effort of shaping with a brush. It's smooth and easily sits on top of my skin tint or foundation and warms my face back up. A little bit of blush and I'm good to go!

I am still so amazed by this phenomenal product even months after I received it!! My use of the one word ""WOW"" is really all you need to know lol. I've tried sooooo many other products claiming to give you that ""dewy, glowy"" look without making you look greasy and oily...but sadly, they always did, and until I found this AMAZING product, I was only wasting more of my hard-earned money on more pricey products that promised the moon when all they ever delivered was grease/oil on my face! Yuck! So of course I was a bit skeptical about giving this product a chance, but I do overall like most e.l.f. products (yes, I admit I've used some pretty bad ones from them, but hopefully by now they've improved those previous low-quality products I had tried; I mean, haven't we all basically experienced disappointment with pretty much every mainstream beauty brand we try out? AT LEAST once, anyway)? Well, back to this product review. Thought I'd give it a try too because I've also always loved e.l.f.'s prices, and figured if I didn't like it, I could just return it anyway and it's not like I'd be out tons of money if for some reason I couldn't return it.  I think the e.l.f. brand has also became so much more successful and big not only to growing the selection of its products but also improving their quality. In addition, a huge part of their success (imo anyways) is that they've always stayed pretty true to their price range/category for their products (and that price category is wayyyyy more affordable for pretty much ANY woman - YAY FOR US AND YAY FOR E.L.F.)!! This product comes in a heavier glass bottle, so you have to be a bit careful not to drop and break it (duhhh I know but had to mention it)!  But it's also partially heavy not because of just the glass bottle but also because you get a decent amount of the actual product inside the bottle! I have tons of other similar products, most though are in fairly small tubes; sure, they can't break like glass bottles can but they also don't hold a nice amount of product like this one does. Granted, you don't need a ton of highlighter in general; one doesn't want to look like they just walked through some type of weird glitter factory (btw, absolutely NO GLITTER in this, not even a tiny trace of any, so yayyyy!) - but again, just emphasizing how much product you get for the price and what a great value it is compared to most others I've tried, which is a big deal to me (I'm not super rich lol, and affordable, amazing products are very hard to come by, as I think most of us can relate to). The very first time I used this product, I hadn't had much sleep the night before (I struggle with severe insomnia; I have for decades), and I admit I pretty much looked like a severely hung-over person would look lol. I splashed some cool water on my face (I was soooo exhausted!) and grabbed my new bottle of e.l.f.'s glowy ""magic-in-a-bottle"" (what I like to call it at times, ha!), and thought ""what the heck, I'll try it because I really can't look much worse than I do now!""  I had some hope but not a ton of it as I opened up that glass bottle. Then I began to use the larger doe foot applicator (it comes with the product) to apply a few various-sized dots on my face (about the sizes of nickels and dimes, etc.).  I thought the applicator was pretty easy to use and it smoothly applied a good, decent amount of product to my face. I  dotted the liquid onto my chin, cheeks, around/under my eyes (careful not to get too close to my eyes, common sense), a bit along the bridge of my nose, my forehead, and then my temple areas. Basically my entire face lol. Now mind you I skipped any kind of actual specific primers, moisturizers, etc. before applying this product as I really wanted to see exactly how it looked on my skin without anything but that on it! Normally I do apply moisturizer, primer, sunscreen, etc. (when I applied those on later before this product, it didn't change how wonderfully beautiful it still worked and looked on my face)!  I didn't wait too long to start carefully and gently rubbing the liquid into my skin before it could dry (if you like to take a bit more time applying, like I do sometimes, then I just apply the product one section of my face at a time and get the same great results). The liquid feels silky, a bit thin but not too much or watery, and blended in nicely just using my fingers (I really don't use spongey applicators to blend my face makeup, as I get too impatient and constantly have to wash them - they grow and spread bacteria way too much, too often, something I'd rather avoid altogether - so, usually I just use my fingers and wash my hands a lot right then and there of course).  Once everything was well blended and my skin had absorbed every last drop of the product, I could not, absolutely could NOT believe my eyes! Or my other senses! My face has never ""glowed"" or looked so naturally ""dewy"" EVER! I had FINALLY achieved the perfect glowy/dewy look I'd wanted for so long and waited forever for!  Note: keep in mind, a little of this stuff can go a long way depending on the look you are trying to achieve and/or how much liquid make-up products you prefer to apply onto your face). Surprisingly it actually did provide some actual, slight coverage on my face too (just enough to make my skin look flawless, which is perfect)! I'm actually still in shock lol. My identical twin sister, who never liked that ""dewy"" look, couldn't even resist it herself after seeing me wear it every day - she finally gave in and uses it all the time now - she absolutely loves it!  I also love the fact that you can wear it under your regular face makeup too, use it as a glowy primer, or, just only wear it with no other make-up products (like on those days when you just want a tiny bit of coverage and/or glow/dewyness, but don't feel like doing your entire makeup routine...because let's face it, ladies...there are just some days when the last thing we want to go through is our usual, sometimes pretty time-consuming makeup ""rituals"")!  On days like those (which are happening more and more as I get older, ugh!) I would much rather just apply a little bit of whatever, like this perfect glowy skin perfector, before running out the door to face the day! If you don't have a makeup routine? Cool! You can still quickly just dab this on your face, rub it in, and end up wherever you're going on time but this time you'll not only be on time, you'll also be an extremely, extra-glowing beauty! I'm serious, even if I had to be cheesy there :)  (yes, this product is THAT PHENOMENAL and I am NOT writing this review for ANYTHING in return; wanted to make that very clear). Also:My skin is combo, but mostly dry. It can get pretty oily in my T-zone area by the latter part of the day. But with this product I just glow and keep glowing, and dew dew dew it all day long, lol, NO LIE!! (Oops! Dang it, sorry about the cheesiness again! Lol)!  I never have to reapply it either, which is wonderful. It's perfect for wearing on a cozy weekend snuggled up with your significant other when you still wanna look gorgeous and sexy but don't want to put on a lot of makeup etc. With this, I can just skip the primer and even the moisturizer (but I still try to at least get some sunscreen in there, which we all know is very important), which saves me a ton of time and it also allows me to be able to go out to run errands, etc. without worrying about my makeup/skin/how I look! And for such an affordable price it's a very rare value!! Believe me, please, when I say that this product is true ""magic-in-a-bottle"" that smashes all those other similar products to bits! I'm so confident about this product that I just felt I HAD to finally write a review (after using it for months now with so many positive experiences wearing it). I want all women to know that they CAN, VERY EASILY, get that perfect, model-like, airbrushed, naked, glowing, dewy, no-makeup look without looking oily and greasy all day - that look which I had literally given up on ever looking like and blaming it on my skin or just thinking something was wrong with me lol - it's obviously the products we choose to wear, NOT us! I feel so naturally beautiful when wearing this and I've had so many people, even strangers, compliment me on my skin and ask how they could get their skin to look so youthful and glowing exactly like mine. And, get this - one was an actual, genuine pretty physician herself who asked me!! She asked me to write down what the product was so she could get a bottle of her own ""magic""! NOT KIDDING!! Ok, so I apologize how long this review got, and if you made it this far, kudos to you! Like I said, I just REALLY want to share my success with this product and give e.l.f. a great review of course!  And I'm not ""sexist"" etc. either - hey, ANY HUMAN BEING can and will love using this if they want that youthful, glowy/dewy look! Give it a try! If you don't like it, obviously you can return it, and if you somehow miss the return deadline or something, you won't be kicking yourself because it's such an affordable beauty product! All you have to gain is gorgeous, glowing, jaw-dropping skin and no need to wear any other makeup unless you want to!  Sometimes I'll rub in e.l.f.'s liquid blush in Rose to Slay and use their glowing contour and highlighting tubes in fair to light, Candlelit Campaign, etc. for a bit more beautiful, natural color to my face. I absolutely love love love these 3 e.l.f. products!!  5/5 STARS ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

The e.l.f. Halo Glow Liquid Filter is a game-changer for those seeking a natural, dewy complexion without the heaviness of a traditional foundation. I use powder foundation often, but it's not as dewy or glowy as this product or a liquid foundation in general. With a lot of my friends saying this is is perfect balance between coverage and comfort, I was eager to put this product to the test.The first thing that struck me about the e.l.f. Halo Glow Liquid Filter is its sheer coverage and lightweight finish. It glides onto the skin effortlessly, giving a light wash of color to even out the skin tone. I use concealer to cover up dark marks and my hormonal acne. I love wearing this everyday because of its lightweight formula is a breath of fresh air compared to heavy foundations that can leave your skin feeling suffocated.One of the standout features of this product is its ability to deliver a radiant glow that looks both natural and healthy. It's like capturing the perfect ""lit-from-within"" look without the need for highlighters, foundation, or a lot of extra products. It's really a one and done! The subtle shimmer in the formula catches the light beautifully, giving your skin a luminous boost that lasts all day.The only downside is the limited shade range. While the e.l.f. Halo Glow Liquid Filter is a wonderful option for those with medium-toned skin, it falls short in accommodating individuals with darker or paler complexions. This oversight is disappointing, as makeup should be inclusive and accessible to everyone.In conclusion, the e.l.f. Halo Glow Liquid Filter is a fantastic choice for those who want a sheer, lightweight, and radiant finish that's leagues ahead of heavy foundations. It effortlessly achieves a natural and healthy glow that enhances your beauty. However, e.l.f. needs to seriously expand its shade range to cater to a broader spectrum of skin tones, so that everyone can enjoy this glowing sensation!

I love this foundation it has multiple coverage options, lasts all day, and easy to blend. If wanting more of a full coverage/last all day effect use a brush to apply, but if you could care less and just want it blended use a sponge. I like that not only does this product look super pretty and natural- it has the perfect glow. Expensive look for less than half the price.I use this, concealer for dark areas, and a translucent powder. Contour prn.Also: I have super sensitive skin with occasional blemishes.

First off, I have to say I absolutely love elf and most of my makeup staples are from them! It’s affordable and they are great quality and works just as good if not better than some high end products.It took me a while to finally purchase this item after the whole hype but I finally got my hands on them as I was looking for something that can provide a dewy hydrated look while having slight coverage (something that can even out my skin tone but still show my imperfections -freckles, acne scars and whatnot). When I tried this product my first reaction was that it was definitely more lotion like and as I rubbed the product into my skin using my fingers it left a lot of streaks and was hard to blend and felt like it was sitting on top of my skin. But overall I still really enjoy the product because it gave me what I was looking for and I just use a brush application method to avoid the streaks! And yes, it is super glowy like all the reviews say. So much that I might not wear it completely on its own because it looks a bit too metallic and unnatural on myself but it’s great to add another shear tint to balance it out ( I add 1-2 drops of the L’Oréal tinted serum)

This formula is SO GOOD. I’ve gone through so many foundations in my makeup wearing days and this one truly is incredible. It feels so light but gives good coverage. It’s not a full coverage foundation but that’s exactly what I wanted. It allows for concealer and bronzer to not look so caked on after this is applied as a base and looks more like natural skin. Goes on smoothly and is a really good price.

I thought the color would be a little too dark for me, but it turned out perfect. It isn’t too thick but still covers enough so you don’t even need foundation! It was easy to blend, didn’t dry my skin out, and lasted all night. I use the Lumi Glotion by L’Oreal as a base, then the liquid filter and the color turns out perfect. I’m bottom right in the photo, and I went right to bed when I got home from our girls’ night (a few drinks were had) without removing the makeup. The product stayed on overnight! I recommend using the elf Power Grip Dewy Setting Spray on top for the perfect glow. This is a must have!

So, I decided to give the e.l.f. Halo Glow Liquid Filter a whirl, hoping to turn my skin from ""dull daily routine"" to ""divine radiance"". Spoiler alert: I'm now glowing so much, I might start guiding lost ships at sea.First Impressions and Packaging:At first glance, the packaging screams sleek and chic, much like the outfit I’d wear if I ever left my sweatpants.Texture, Application, and Feel:The texture is smoother than my dance moves on a Saturday night. It’s lightweight, and blending it into my skin was easier than my decision to hit snooze every morning. It left my skin feeling like it had just had a spa day – hydrated, happy, and slightly confused about being treated so well.Performance and Wear:This liquid filter promises a glowing, soft-focus effect, and let me tell you, it delivers. I looked in the mirror and thought, “Who is she, and how can I keep her around?” It's like having an Instagram filter in a bottle, minus the digital manipulation and existential crisis.Scent and Ingredients:It's fragrance-free, which is perfect for anyone whose skin throws a tantrum at the slightest whiff of perfume. The ingredient list didn't require me to have a chemistry degree to understand, so that's a plus.Versatility:You can wear it alone, mix it with foundation, or apply it as a highlighter. It's like the Swiss Army knife of makeup, but please don't take it camping.Value for Money:Considering it turns my complexion from ""meh"" to ""miraculous"" without requiring a small loan, I'd say it's good value for money.Final Thoughts:Overall, the e.l.f. Halo Glow Liquid Filter is like a magic wand for your face. It gives a natural, radiant glow that says, “I drink enough water and get eight hours of sleep” even if your lifestyle screams the opposite. Highly recommend if you want to look like you're glowing with health, or if you just enjoy pretending you have your life together.

I was watching a make up artist on you tube expressing how surprised she was how great this is.  She said its better then the expensive stuff. I agree it's not expensive & it works great.it covers great & is not heavy looking. It is a little dark. I ordered medium beige. I have olive skin tone & it works for me.

I love this product. Shade 3.5 is perfection for fair olive skin. It makes my skin look like I wish it looked like naturally!!! It’s not too orange. It is a bit too shiny. And it’s much thicker than a d bronzi. The d bronzi has a better formula. This has more glitter and dries down a bit. My oily skin looks much worse at the end of the day when I use this product. No amounts of touch ups or blotting can remedy. I’ve tried. It also breaks me out (which a lot of drug store products do. I wish I knew what ingredient was doing it) I continue to use it for days when I want no make up looks and don’t need it to look good all day because the color is sooooo nuanced and good. If they would make it in a gel version no shimmer id deal with the breakout just for the color. Fair olive toned girls know the struggle of everything being too pink or orange!! Nothing else I’ve ever tried matches me this good :(

I really like this product. I'm happy I got the right shade for my light olive skin, but I also like that it's very light coverage and dewy for certain summertime looks (especially evening makeup since it's SO glowy). It kind of reminds me of the glass skin/glazed donut look which I've always loved even if it goes in and out of fashion. If you want this to be more of a daytime product, though, I would probably use it conservatively and mix it with a similar consistency BB or CC cream (my favorite is the IT cosmetics one).

And, get this - one was an actual, genuine pretty physician herself who asked me!! She asked me to write down what the product was so she could get a bottle of her own ""magic""! NOT KIDDING!! Ok, so I apologize how long this review got, and if you made it this far, kudos to you! Like I said, I just REALLY want to share my success with this product and give e.l.f. a great review of course!  And I'm not ""sexist"" etc. either - hey, ANY HUMAN BEING can and will love using this if they want that youthful, glowy/dewy look! Give it a try! If you don't like it, obviously you can return it, and if you somehow miss the return deadline or something, you won't be kicking yourself because it's such an affordable beauty product! All you have to gain is gorgeous, glowing, jaw-dropping skin and no need to wear any other makeup unless you want to!  Sometimes I'll rub in e.l.f.'s liquid blush in Rose to Slay and use their glowing contour and highlighting tubes in fair to light, Candlelit Campaign, etc. for a bit more beautiful, natural color to my face. I absolutely love love love these 3 e.l.f. products!!  5/5 STARS ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

The e.l.f. Halo Glow Liquid Filter is a game-changer for those seeking a natural, dewy complexion without the heaviness of a traditional foundation. I use powder foundation often, but it's not as dewy or glowy as this product or a liquid foundation in general. With a lot of my friends saying this is is perfect balance between coverage and comfort, I was eager to put this product to the test.The first thing that struck me about the e.l.f. Halo Glow Liquid Filter is its sheer coverage and lightweight finish. It glides onto the skin effortlessly, giving a light wash of color to even out the skin tone. I use concealer to cover up dark marks and my hormonal acne. I love wearing this everyday because of its lightweight formula is a breath of fresh air compared to heavy foundations that can leave your skin feeling suffocated.One of the standout features of this product is its ability to deliver a radiant glow that looks both natural and healthy. It's like capturing the perfect ""lit-from-within"" look without the need for highlighters, foundation, or a lot of extra products. It's really a one and done! The subtle shimmer in the formula catches the light beautifully, giving your skin a luminous boost that lasts all day.The only downside is the limited shade range. While the e.l.f. Halo Glow Liquid Filter is a wonderful option for those with medium-toned skin, it falls short in accommodating individuals with darker or paler complexions. This oversight is disappointing, as makeup should be inclusive and accessible to everyone.In conclusion, the e.l.f. Halo Glow Liquid Filter is a fantastic choice for those who want a sheer, lightweight, and radiant finish that's leagues ahead of heavy foundations. It effortlessly achieves a natural and healthy glow that enhances your beauty. However, e.l.f. needs to seriously expand its shade range to cater to a broader spectrum of skin tones, so that everyone can enjoy this glowing sensation!

I love this foundation it has multiple coverage options, lasts all day, and easy to blend. If wanting more of a full coverage/last all day effect use a brush to apply, but if you could care less and just want it blended use a sponge. I like that not only does this product look super pretty and natural- it has the perfect glow. Expensive look for less than half the price.I use this, concealer for dark areas, and a translucent powder. Contour prn.Also: I have super sensitive skin with occasional blemishes.

First off, I have to say I absolutely love elf and most of my makeup staples are from them! It’s affordable and they are great quality and works just as good if not better than some high end products.It took me a while to finally purchase this item after the whole hype but I finally got my hands on them as I was looking for something that can provide a dewy hydrated look while having slight coverage (something that can even out my skin tone but still show my imperfections -freckles, acne scars and whatnot). When I tried this product my first reaction was that it was definitely more lotion like and as I rubbed the product into my skin using my fingers it left a lot of streaks and was hard to blend and felt like it was sitting on top of my skin. But overall I still really enjoy the product because it gave me what I was looking for and I just use a brush application method to avoid the streaks! And yes, it is super glowy like all the reviews say. So much that I might not wear it completely on its own because it looks a bit too metallic and unnatural on myself but it’s great to add another shear tint to balance it out ( I add 1-2 drops of the L’Oréal tinted serum)

This formula is SO GOOD. I’ve gone through so many foundations in my makeup wearing days and this one truly is incredible. It feels so light but gives good coverage. It’s not a full coverage foundation but that’s exactly what I wanted. It allows for concealer and bronzer to not look so caked on after this is applied as a base and looks more like natural skin. Goes on smoothly and is a really good price.
"
115,"
I thought the color would be a little too dark for me, but it turned out perfect. It isn’t too thick but still covers enough so you don’t even need foundation! It was easy to blend, didn’t dry my skin out, and lasted all night. I use the Lumi Glotion by L’Oreal as a base, then the liquid filter and the color turns out perfect. I’m bottom right in the photo, and I went right to bed when I got home from our girls’ night (a few drinks were had) without removing the makeup. The product stayed on overnight! I recommend using the elf Power Grip Dewy Setting Spray on top for the perfect glow. This is a must have!

So, I decided to give the e.l.f. Halo Glow Liquid Filter a whirl, hoping to turn my skin from ""dull daily routine"" to ""divine radiance"". Spoiler alert: I'm now glowing so much, I might start guiding lost ships at sea.First Impressions and Packaging:At first glance, the packaging screams sleek and chic, much like the outfit I’d wear if I ever left my sweatpants.Texture, Application, and Feel:The texture is smoother than my dance moves on a Saturday night. It’s lightweight, and blending it into my skin was easier than my decision to hit snooze every morning. It left my skin feeling like it had just had a spa day – hydrated, happy, and slightly confused about being treated so well.Performance and Wear:This liquid filter promises a glowing, soft-focus effect, and let me tell you, it delivers. I looked in the mirror and thought, “Who is she, and how can I keep her around?” It's like having an Instagram filter in a bottle, minus the digital manipulation and existential crisis.Scent and Ingredients:It's fragrance-free, which is perfect for anyone whose skin throws a tantrum at the slightest whiff of perfume. The ingredient list didn't require me to have a chemistry degree to understand, so that's a plus.Versatility:You can wear it alone, mix it with foundation, or apply it as a highlighter. It's like the Swiss Army knife of makeup, but please don't take it camping.Value for Money:Considering it turns my complexion from ""meh"" to ""miraculous"" without requiring a small loan, I'd say it's good value for money.Final Thoughts:Overall, the e.l.f. Halo Glow Liquid Filter is like a magic wand for your face. It gives a natural, radiant glow that says, “I drink enough water and get eight hours of sleep” even if your lifestyle screams the opposite. Highly recommend if you want to look like you're glowing with health, or if you just enjoy pretending you have your life together.

I was watching a make up artist on you tube expressing how surprised she was how great this is.  She said its better then the expensive stuff. I agree it's not expensive & it works great.it covers great & is not heavy looking. It is a little dark. I ordered medium beige. I have olive skin tone & it works for me.

I love this product. Shade 3.5 is perfection for fair olive skin. It makes my skin look like I wish it looked like naturally!!! It’s not too orange. It is a bit too shiny. And it’s much thicker than a d bronzi. The d bronzi has a better formula. This has more glitter and dries down a bit. My oily skin looks much worse at the end of the day when I use this product. No amounts of touch ups or blotting can remedy. I’ve tried. It also breaks me out (which a lot of drug store products do. I wish I knew what ingredient was doing it) I continue to use it for days when I want no make up looks and don’t need it to look good all day because the color is sooooo nuanced and good. If they would make it in a gel version no shimmer id deal with the breakout just for the color. Fair olive toned girls know the struggle of everything being too pink or orange!! Nothing else I’ve ever tried matches me this good :(
"

I really like this product. I'm happy I got the right shade for my light olive skin, but I also like that it's very light coverage and dewy for certain summertime looks (especially evening makeup since it's SO glowy). It kind of reminds me of the glass skin/glazed donut look which I've always loved even if it goes in and out of fashion. If you want this to be more of a daytime product, though, I would probably use it conservatively and mix it with a similar consistency BB or CC cream (my favorite is the IT cosmetics one).

My review headline is kind of dumb now that I'm reading it because obviously a white headband that you wear to wash your dirty face with is going to get dirty. This is the viral headband that every influencer wears in their GRWM videos and I am a sheep who needed to get it, too. I do like it and wear it basically every morning and night. I guess I could wash it?? Haven't tried yet...but just be aware that eventually it will get a little dingy.

This is a HG life changing product. In combination with my other skin care items (some of the same brand and some not) this serum has drastically improved the look and feel of my skin. If I ever don’t use it for even a few days, I notice it right away.This serum has made my skin smoother, more hydrated, reduced pore size and minimizes fine lines. It gives my skin a lit from within glow that just can’t be replicated with any other product and provides a plumping bouncy effect to my skin.I use it nightly in conjunction with the Herbivore Moon Fruit serum and Tatcha Dewy Skin Cream. I alternate with using the Pomegranate Peptide Firming Serum and the Strawberry BHA Pore serum in conjunction.I don’t use it under makeup because it’s a little too tacky and doesn’t play well with my primer, but I haven’t felt I needed it more than at night.I have sensitive skin that is prone to eczema and this does not irritate my skin, cause redness, breakouts or sting.I’m 41 and since using this for almost 2 years at this point I get complimented on my skin multiple times a week on average and people are surprised when they learn my age. A lot of my co-workers still think I’m in my late 20’s. It’s that good.I like to use a skincare roller to really push my products into my skin (I have a review ofThe one I use which is a dupe of the Nurse Jamie one). I swear it really helps with absorbency rather that just applying with fingers and calling it a night.

I do like this product and do feel that it is moisturizing. However, I feel like when I use it in the morning, it makes my cheeks a tad red throughout the day. I don't seem to have that issue with other moisturizers. It smells very nice too. Also, another negative is the bottle. After the product is low, you'll need to take the top off and use the rest of the product as there is quite a good amount left in the bottom. Uncertain if I'll buy this again or not still.

You don't need to use a ton of it to get the job done.This is a subscribe for me, no question!

As someone who takes their skincare routine seriously, I'm always on the lookout for products that deliver results. That's why I was excited to try out the e.l.f. SKIN Mini Holy Hydration, it exceeded all my expectations.Let's start with its effectiveness as a makeup remover. This balm melts away even the toughest waterproof makeup effortlessly, leaving my skin feeling clean and refreshed. The formula is gentle yet powerful, effectively dissolving makeup without stripping my skin of its natural oils. Plus, the added infusion of hyaluronic acid provides an extra boost of hydration, leaving my skin feeling soft and supple after each use.One of the things I love most about this cleanser is its versatility. Not only does it remove makeup like a dream, but it also doubles as a facial cleanser. I use it both morning and night to cleanse my skin of impurities, and it always leaves my complexion looking radiant and clear. The compact size of the mini version makes it perfect for travel, ensuring that I can maintain my skincare routine no matter where I go.The texture of the balm is luxurious and smooth, gliding effortlessly onto the skin. It feels like a treat to massage it into my skin, and the subtle, refreshing scent adds to the overall sensory experience. Plus, a little goes a long way, so despite its small size, the product lasts a surprisingly long time.In terms of value for money, this balm is a steal. The quality of the formula rivals that of high-end skincare brands, but at a fraction of the price. It's clear that e.l.f. has put a lot of thought and care into creating a product that delivers real results without breaking the bank.Whether you're a skincare enthusiast like me or just looking for a reliable makeup remover, this product is a must have in your beauty arsenal. Trust me, your skin will thank you.

When I first started double cleansing, I was using Clinique’s Take The Day Off, but it was so expensive.Although I loved it, I decided to try CeraVe’s cleansing balm, but the smell was hard to get passed. I finally found Banila Co.’s cleansing balm and had been using that for quite a while.When I saw that E. L. F. came out with their own, I knew I wanted to try it for the amazing price point! It did not disappoint! Although it does not clear make up as well as Banila Co. the first time, the texture is almost perfect and removes it fairly easily. It’s very lightweight and does not leave my eyes feeling foggy after wiping it with a wet face cloth. I am willing to compromise using a little bit more since the price is so reasonable.

I love this cleanser! It takes make up off like a boss and leaves skin feeling smooth. It rinses off well and does not leave an oily feel. It is easy to use, as you just massage it onto your dry face. I then wet a disposable face cleaning towel and wipe it off. It is a small jar, but a little goes a long way, so it seems like it will last. There is no obnoxious smell, and it does exactly what it says it does. Will definitely repurchase when I run out.

Fantastic cleansing balm for my dry sensitive skin.  This ELF cleansing balm removes products easily (sunscreen, foundation, brow gel,  and even water proof mascara)  and cleanses; leaving skin feeling soft and moisturized.

My usual cleansing balm was out of stock when I needed more, and since I enjoy other e.l.f. products I decided to give this a try.It works well for removing makeup and doesn't dry out my skin. I do typically follow it using another cleanser, because it does seem to leave a film on my skin, but on nights when I'm just rushing to get to bed and shorten my routine, I haven't noticed any negative impact of using this on its own and rinsing for a little longer, then putting on my moisturizer.I knocked off one star for one reason only: Holy cow, the fragrance is awful. It almost has an 'old lady perfume' scent, and the scent lingers (another reason I have to double cleanse). If it was fragrance free, I'd most likely continue purchasing it simply because it's performance is comparable to that of my usual cleansing balm and it comes at a lower price point. With the heavy fragrance though, I'm going to back to my previous product.

They don't joke when they say it melts makeup away. I tried this on waterproof eye makeup and I have never had my makeup removed so completely from any other cleanser I've tried before. I may have used a bit too much for just my eyes, to be fair, but it did do the job!What I will say is that I made a mistake not having a damp cloth or the water running before beginning to use this cleansing balm, because opening your eyes in the middle is NOT recommended. It didn't hurt or anything but it was kinda odd getting it into my eyes and trying to clean it out after the fact.Either way, I would seriously recommend this stuff! It's fabulous and the price is absolutely right!

It did not disappoint! Although it does not clear make up as well as Banila Co. the first time, the texture is almost perfect and removes it fairly easily. It’s very lightweight and does not leave my eyes feeling foggy after wiping it with a wet face cloth. I am willing to compromise using a little bit more since the price is so reasonable.

I love this cleanser! It takes make up off like a boss and leaves skin feeling smooth. It rinses off well and does not leave an oily feel. It is easy to use, as you just massage it onto your dry face. I then wet a disposable face cleaning towel and wipe it off. It is a small jar, but a little goes a long way, so it seems like it will last. There is no obnoxious smell, and it does exactly what it says it does. Will definitely repurchase when I run out.

Fantastic cleansing balm for my dry sensitive skin.  This ELF cleansing balm removes products easily (sunscreen, foundation, brow gel,  and even water proof mascara)  and cleanses; leaving skin feeling soft and moisturized.  It works as well as more expensive cleansing balms. I've purchased it at wal-mart before, but am saving even more by subscribing through Amazon.  Each jar lasts me about 1.5 to 2 months because a little goes a long way.

My usual cleansing balm was out of stock when I needed more, and since I enjoy other e.l.f. products I decided to give this a try.It works well for removing makeup and doesn't dry out my skin. I do typically follow it using another cleanser, because it does seem to leave a film on my skin, but on nights when I'm just rushing to get to bed and shorten my routine, I haven't noticed any negative impact of using this on its own and rinsing for a little longer, then putting on my moisturizer.I knocked off one star for one reason only: Holy cow, the fragrance is awful. It almost has an 'old lady perfume' scent, and the scent lingers (another reason I have to double cleanse). If it was fragrance free, I'd most likely continue purchasing it simply because it's performance is comparable to that of my usual cleansing balm and it comes at a lower price point. With the heavy fragrance though, I'm going to back to my previous product.

They don't joke when they say it melts makeup away. I tried this on waterproof eye makeup and I have never had my makeup removed so completely from any other cleanser I've tried before. I may have used a bit too much for just my eyes, to be fair, but it did do the job!What I will say is that I made a mistake not having a damp cloth or the water running before beginning to use this cleansing balm, because opening your eyes in the middle is NOT recommended. It didn't hurt or anything but it was kinda odd getting it into my eyes and trying to clean it out after the fact.Either way, I would seriously recommend this stuff! It's fabulous and the price is absolutely right!

I've never been one to use a primer but, as I have gotten a little older the heat and I do not get along as well which results in me sweating more...this primer helps my makeup stay on better despite the humid days of summer trying to melt it away!I'm a 40yo, pretty pale complected female and I often find it hard to find something that isn't too bold for my lighter complexion.  Anyone could use this primer since it is perfectly clear, which I love!It does not have an odor or make my skin feel oily in any way and it does not make me break out.  It's light but effective.  You definitely have to give it time to dry after application before putting your foundation on over top of it though...30 seconds to a minute is what I have found to be a good length of time.  The box says 30 seconds but I have not found anything over that to be problematic.Worth trying if you're in the market for a primer!

I recently tried the Elf makeup primer, and it has quickly become an essential part of my beauty routine. This primer creates a flawless base, smoothing out my skin and minimizing the appearance of pores and fine lines. It’s incredibly lightweight and absorbs quickly, leaving a silky finish without any greasiness. My foundation applies effortlessly on top and lasts all day without creasing or fading. I also love that it keeps my skin looking matte and fresh, even in humid conditions. Elf primer has truly enhanced my makeup game, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a reliable and effective primer!

This was a great price for this product. Many saying its a dupe for Pixi.  I'm new to cream & liquid blushes, so I'm trying some out on the low end of the pricing scale to see of I like using them. I'm a bit older and notice skin changes (dullness, dryness) where maybe a cream or liquid blush might be better than a powder. The color payoff on this product is nice and light, but the color is noticeable. And the blush part came intact in the tube in my delivery (as opposed to some pics i saw posted on the reviews here where it fell apart). But since I had an issue with another brand's cream blush in a tube, I realize all these cream blushes in a push up tube might not be suitable for travel (business or leisure), especially in warmer months. So it's staying put at home where I will use it there.

This blush stick is just like the one I keep seeing all over TikTok, but better! It's inexpensive, yet so high quality. I blend it in with my beauty blender and it provides such a natural sun-kissed tone to my cheeks and nose.

It's nice and smooth going on and it's pretty and shiny, but it's definitely not cherry.  In fact, it seems like there was no color at all when I put it on.

If you want just a nice shiny lip gloss it works for that, or maybe to put it on top of a colored lipstick. But if you're looking to color your lips and have a gloss it's not for you.

I was looking at buying the new Armani liquid blush.  This came up as a sugestion from Amazon so I thought I would try it since it was only $5 before I paid $45 for the Armani. This product is beautifu!  I it a weird aplicator, so I dab some on my hand and then use a brush to apply to my face.  The color is a perfect shade of pink and lasts on my skin all day.  I have gotten a ton of complements about how pretty it looks on me:-)  I will warn you that because of the weird applicator, the bottle can get a little leaky if you do not close it corectly, otherwise - I highly recomend it!

I got the both the blush and the contour and the contour was literally perfect so i had really high hopes for the blush. It for the most part is excellent, exactly the shade i wanted, the perfect amount of color without it being too over powering, however the seal on the blush broke at some point and no it just spills out of the bottle if it is even remotely not perfectly upright. I’m not sure if it was a me issue or the products since the contour has the same style of bottle and has not done this but just a warning for sure. everything else about this blush i love!

As a beginner to using blush, this is the first liquid blush I've tried and it's AMAZING! I only need to use 1 dot since it's super pigmented. I have normal to oily skin and it works great! No patchiness, no pilling, blends easily. Keep in mind that it does dry quickly so you need to work fast.

I have very fair, very cool toned skin. Anything with even a HINT of warmth looks even warmer on me (like like those with warm undertones who use anything even slightly cool looks even cooler toned on them). It’s hard finding good blush shades for my very cool skin. I’ll get a pink and it ends up looking peach if it has a little warmth to it (and many do, although now the cool toned baby pink has become more popular, finding a pink that works for me hasn’t been as hard as it used to be). But I found dusty pinks, mauves, purple, berry, and plum tones look best on me. With berry tones, I usually need to be careful since I’m very fair and most are deeper in color. They can also lean warm and end up looking more like a red on me than a berry. The shade “Night Drive” in the first photo looked like it was a beautiful dusty rose color. In the photo showing all the shades swatched together, it looked like a beautiful plum color. But then in the other photo where it showed the 3 new shades and had a shade description, the color looked like it was more of a reddish berry, but was described as a deep plum red. To me it’s either plum (a purple toned shade) or red, but I guess “deep plum red” means it’s a berry with a red tone. I was hoping it would end up looking more like it did in the first photo (a kind of dusty rose color) or the swatch photo (a beautiful plum color), and not be too red toned.They have both matte and shimmer finishes. 4 shades have a shimmer finish and 11 shades have a matte finish. Some shades come in both finishes - matte and shimmer - while some of the others only come in one finish (either matte or shimmer). I was happy when I saw the shade I wanted (“Night Drive”) was one of the matte shades. I don’t like my blushes to be shimmery. Shimmery usually means glittery, which I don’t like. Shimmer/glitter can accentuate texture and fine lines, plus depending on the shimmer (if it’s larger shimmer/glitter particles), then that can migrate to the rest of my face. And even if there’s no glitter, dewy/glowy finishes still can accentuate texture and fine lines. So I prefer my blushes to be matte, and I can add glow another way if I want it.In person, the shade is more like it appeared in the photo showing the 3 new shades with the description, and I’d definitely agree with the description of “deep plum red.” It definitely is a kind of plum color but with a red tone to it. On my very cool toned skin, it shows more as a red than I wanted, but it still looks nice.The component is nice! It’s a plastic, hexagonal tube that has a soft, baby pink kind of color that has a frosted gradient look to it. The top twists off to reveal a pointed sponge tip that you can easily dot onto the cheeks. When the sponge tip goes into the bottom of the tube, there’s a piece inside that I guess is kind of like a stopper to keep too much product from coming out. I was worried how that’ll work once I’ve used these a lot and they start to get low - will I still be able to get product on the sponge? Because with that stopper in there, it seems like once it gets low and the product isn’t hitting that spot, I wonder how it gets the product? But only time will tell. So far, I’ve been using this shade off and on for 5 months and it doesn’t seem like there’s any less product on the sponge tip when I take it out now than there was when I first started using it. So I’m happy about that.You get enough product on the sponge tip where you can use the tip to dot it on your cheeks. That’s how I’ve been preferring it when I apply it. I take the pointed tip, and do a couple tiny dots. Then I take my fave brush for any liquid/cream product (Elf Putty Brush) and dab the product out. I stamp the brush over the dots to spread the color out where I want it, and then keep lightly stamping to blend it to where I want it. It blends out nice and easy. I prefer doing dots on one side, blending that out, then doing the dots on the other side. I have tried it where I apply the dots to both sides and blend out one side then go to the other, and I’m still able to blend the other side easily. I also tried applying some to the back of my hand (stamping the sponge onto the back of my hand, then dabbing my brush into it to pick some product up and spreading it evenly on the brush) then going in and applying it on my cheeks. This worked well to, but I felt like I wasted a decent amount of product doing it this way. I had to keep putting more on the back of my hand to pick up more product. But this is a good way to do it if you feel like it’s too pigmented or want a slight wash of color.Unfortunately, even on my very dry skin, this does NOT look matte AT ALL. It looks REALLY dewy. Thankfully, it doesn’t have any shimmer to it. But it has a very dewy look to it. Because of that, I feel like it can sometimes pick up product underneath (like my foundation), which I HATE! I at the same time I got this, I also got 2 shades of the SheGlam Sun Sculpt Bronzers and I LOVE those. They apply nice and easy, dry down and set on their own, and have a matte finish but not too matte where it looks dry. They’re beautiful. I was expecting the formula of this blush, being a matte finish, to be similar to those. So I was pretty disappointed when it wasn’t. I have to be really careful when applying it to make sure my foundation underneath doesn’t lift up. I have to usually wait a bit after I apply my foundation before I apply this, which just isn’t always easy to do. I use a fan sometimes to speed the process up. But, it’s just not something I like having to deal with. I’ve used tons of liquid/cream blush formulas and I’ve never had issues with them lifting any of my foundations underneath when using my HG brush for them (the Elf Putty Brush). There’s just something about that brush that’s always magic with liquid blushes. But NOT with this one. I also tried using a sponge and my fingers, and still had the same thing. I’ve tried this with different foundation formulas and finishes. This seems to work best with a matte foundation, but even then, I need to be careful when applying it so foundation doesn’t lift up underneath. I tried setting my face with powder before applying this and that didn’t work at all! It just made this look patchy and uneven. So, I just need to let my foundation set completely on its own before applying this and be careful when applying it so it doesn’t lift my foundation underneath. Then, I need to put a tiny bit of powder of this so that it doesn’t look so dewy.Overall, this one wasn’t a win for me. I LOVE the Sun Sculpts (in shade Tawny Amber for bronzer and Soft Tan for contour). If the formula on this blush was like those, I’d love this too. But, unfortunately, it’s not. It’s glowy when it’s supposed to be matte and just finicky to work with. So this isn’t something I’d recommend unless you WANT a dewy blush that isn’t shimmery/glittery and don’t mind it might be finicky to work with and lift up your foundation. I give it 3 stars. It’s okay, but not great.

I see now why everyone loves this brand of blushes. I see them all over my TikTok. I ordered the peach and it livens up my pale olive skin for the perfect natural blush/sun kissed skin look. Pale cool olive skin can be such a pain for blush shades (well all makeup shades really) but this is beautiful and blends super easy with just a few taps of your fingers. Will buy again, I can see this being a staple in my make up routine. Even looks cute as a cheek flush on the no make up/no foundation days. For reverence I am 42, my skin is on the dryer side and this looks great.

I was looking at buying the new Armani liquid blush.  This came up as a sugestion from Amazon so I thought I would try it since it was only $5 before I paid $45 for the Armani. This product is beautifu!  I it a weird aplicator, so I dab some on my hand and then use a brush to apply to my face.  The color is a perfect shade of pink and lasts on my skin all day.  I have gotten a ton of complements about how pretty it looks on me:-)  I will warn you that because of the weird applicator, the bottle can get a little leaky if you do not close it corectly, otherwise - I highly recomend it!

This shade is beautiful. I have fair, cool toned skin and it blends like butter. Love it! Not patchy on top of foundation. A little goes a long way. I prefer to put the dots on the back of my hand and pick up the product with a brush. Definitely recommend. Going to get more shades.

I got the both the blush and the contour and the contour was literally perfect so i had really high hopes for the blush. It for the most part is excellent, exactly the shade i wanted, the perfect amount of color without it being too over powering, however the seal on the blush broke at some point and no it just spills out of the bottle if it is even remotely not perfectly upright. I’m not sure if it was a me issue or the products since the contour has the same style of bottle and has not done this but just a warning for sure. everything else about this blush i love!

Actually I was looking for a little lighter color in shade but this color is equally good. What I like about liquid blushes is they sits into your skin and looks like your real skin they don’t look artificial or powdery on your face. Worth buying for this price.

As a beginner to using blush, this is the first liquid blush I've tried and it's AMAZING! I only need to use 1 dot since it's super pigmented. I have normal to oily skin and it works great! No patchiness, no pilling, blends easily. Keep in mind that it does dry quickly so you need to work fast.

I have very fair, very cool toned skin. Anything with even a HINT of warmth looks even warmer on me (like like those with warm undertones who use anything even slightly cool looks even cooler toned on them). It’s hard finding good blush shades for my very cool skin. I’ll get a pink and it ends up looking peach if it has a little warmth to it (and many do, although now the cool toned baby pink has become more popular, finding a pink that works for me hasn’t been as hard as it used to be). But I found dusty pinks, mauves, purple, berry, and plum tones look best on me. With berry tones, I usually need to be careful since I’m very fair and most are deeper in color. They can also lean warm and end up looking more like a red on me than a berry. The shade “Night Drive” in the first photo looked like it was a beautiful dusty rose color. In the photo showing all the shades swatched together, it looked like a beautiful plum color. But then in the other photo where it showed the 3 new shades and had a shade description, the color looked like it was more of a reddish berry, but was described as a deep plum red. To me it’s either plum (a purple toned shade) or red, but I guess “deep plum red” means it’s a berry with a red tone. I was hoping it would end up looking more like it did in the first photo (a kind of dusty rose color) or the swatch photo (a beautiful plum color), and not be too red toned.They have both matte and shimmer finishes. 4 shades have a shimmer finish and 11 shades have a matte finish. Some shades come in both finishes - matte and shimmer - while some of the others only come in one finish (either matte or shimmer). I was happy when I saw the shade I wanted (“Night Drive”) was one of the matte shades. I don’t like my blushes to be shimmery. Shimmery usually means glittery, which I don’t like. Shimmer/glitter can accentuate texture and fine lines, plus depending on the shimmer (if it’s larger shimmer/glitter particles), then that can migrate to the rest of my face. And even if there’s no glitter, dewy/glowy finishes still can accentuate texture and fine lines. So I prefer my blushes to be matte, and I can add glow another way if I want it.In person, the shade is more like it appeared in the photo showing the 3 new shades with the description, and I’d definitely agree with the description of “deep plum red.” It definitely is a kind of plum color but with a red tone to it.

My 16y.o. daughter originally asked for face wipes, but then asked for Micellar water instead since we have about 1k cotton pads already.  I followed up with her 2x since we bought it.  She happily gushed about the product, citing that it works much better than the disposable makeup wipes she used to use.  A few weeks later, I hit her up again.  She had been using this in lieu of face wipes for almost 3 weeks at that time.  She showed me before and after, as well as what came off onto the cotton pad which was noticeable.  She went on to say how the moisturizing really seems to work and that she loves how her skin feels regularly now.  She also reminded me that the cotton pads that she uses instead of the makeup wipes are actually more biodegradable and better for the environment, which makes me happy.  She would have been through the thing of wipes by now, but has about half the bottle left atm.  I was thinking that the Micellar water would be more expensive in the long run along with the cotton pads, but I think that now she is getting a better product for roughly (if not less than) the same price.  She likes other Garnier products so this is a great addition for her.  I'm a single dad and just trying to keep up with the times.  I'm glad they have affordable products like this on Amazon which, with the reviews, helps me figure out what is best for her (and best value for me) from the comfort of my home.

The first thing I noticed when I opened the bottle was the smell--hard to describe but not pleasant. It looks and feels great on my skin though, with a slightly dewy finish that is great for mature skin like mine but may not be a plus for those with oilier skin. It's pretty much undetectable on my skin apart from the fact that my skin looks better. I bought the shade oro. I thought it may be too dark, but it's not at all. The coverage is surprisingly good for a serum foundation. The fact that it's SPF 40 was a huge selling point for me. I should add that I had my husband do a sniff test on my face once I'd applied the foundation and he didn't notice a bad smell. I guess it dissipates when out of the bottle. I will definitely buy this again. I would give it 5 stars if not for the smell.

Light coverage. Goes on very light. No caking in lines at all. I’ve been using it for a couple of months now and my skin has improved. Softer. Aging it was hard for me to find over the counter makeup that looked good and didn’t make me look older. This make up doesn’t settle in lines at all. It covers lightly and you can build without it caking up. It looks very natural. It has a dewy finish so a light finishing powder is recommended. I love it and will absolutely buy it again.

I’m 43. Fair skinned with light hair and blue eyes. I did the color match through Ilia’s website and bought through Amazon. First, the color match seems to right on. I thought it would be too dark for my fair complexion but I went with it and it worked. Next, application. That’s where I am not sure how I feel about this product. It is kind of thick and doesn’t really spread that well. And if you use too much it’s a disaster of thick goopy makeup. I have combo skin and can get oily throughout the day. I don’t think this makeup is for people with oily skin. The finish on the product is dewy to begin with but the makeup just never sets! Like never. I’ve seen the responses from Ilia about setting it with their powder and I’ve done that. It still seems too sticky for my taste. And it claims to reduce the look of pores (I’ve seen those adds pop up all over). It does not reduce the look of pores or hide any imperfections you might have. I don’t think this product does any favors for my 43 year old skin. My advice: don’t buy into the hype in the targeted ads. Save your money. This product is not worth half the price I paid for it. Finally, if you have any sensitivity to scent you will not like this product. It smells like I’ve put honey on my face! And I can smell the lingering scent throughout the day.

I have been looking for a moisturizing foundation. I was using a cream stick, but wanted to change. I had looked at a bunch of cream foundations, including this one. I was a little hesitant the videos that people make using this foundation I really amazing this skin is Dewey but These people are also in their 30s and I am in my 60s. I was a little hesitant but thrilled with the results. You might think it's expensive for the amount you're getting you need very little lasts  all day. If you're Middle-aged or older and looking for a foundation that gives you a glowing look this is for you. You will not be disappointed.

Very light weight. It feels thick at first, but blends in to your skin and you can put foundation right over it and not feel too thick. The smell is kind of like play dough, but it doesn’t last long you can’t smell it while wearing it through the day. It doesn’t make my face greasy.

This is the only thing I wear on my face for a light coverage. Have been using for a couple years, must be on my 6th or 7th bottle and I love it. Super light, glides over the skin and feels amazing and healthy on. No perfume smell, very earthy. Great product.

Just started using this, but I can tell you this product is great, I have dry skin and this glides on, color was perfect, love that it’s lightweight, doesn’t feel like your wearing anything, it blends wells and evens out my skin, giving it a lovely glow!  Will purchase again!

I care about the quality of the ingredients so I love that this is clean, and makes my skin look healthy and hydrated. It has a slight strange smell and first but it quickly fades away. I would recommend.I sent a selfie into the company so they could match my skin tone. I then ordered it from Amazon once I knew the color I needed.

The first thing I noticed when I opened the bottle was the smell--hard to describe but not pleasant. It looks and feels great on my skin though, with a slightly dewy finish that is great for mature skin like mine but may not be a plus for those with oilier skin. It's pretty much undetectable on my skin apart from the fact that my skin looks better. I bought the shade oro. I thought it may be too dark, but it's not at all. The coverage is surprisingly good for a serum foundation. The fact that it's SPF 40 was a huge selling point for me. I should add that I had my husband do a sniff test on my face once I'd applied the foundation and he didn't notice a bad smell. I guess it dissipates when out of the bottle. I will definitely buy this again. I would give it 5 stars if not for the smell.

Light coverage. Goes on very light. No caking in lines at all. I’ve been using it for a couple of months now and my skin has improved. Softer. Aging it was hard for me to find over the counter makeup that looked good and didn’t make me look older. This make up doesn’t settle in lines at all. It covers lightly and you can build without it caking up. It looks very natural. It has a dewy finish so a light finishing powder is recommended. I love it and will absolutely buy it again.

I’m 43. Fair skinned with light hair and blue eyes. I did the color match through Ilia’s website and bought through Amazon. First, the color match seems to right on. I thought it would be too dark for my fair complexion but I went with it and it worked. Next, application. That’s where I am not sure how I feel about this product. It is kind of thick and doesn’t really spread that well. And if you use too much it’s a disaster of thick goopy makeup. I have combo skin and can get oily throughout the day. I don’t think this makeup is for people with oily skin. The finish on the product is dewy to begin with but the makeup just never sets! Like never. I’ve seen the responses from Ilia about setting it with their powder and I’ve done that. It still seems too sticky for my taste. And it claims to reduce the look of pores (I’ve seen those adds pop up all over). It does not reduce the look of pores or hide any imperfections you might have. I don’t think this product does any favors for my 43 year old skin. My advice: don’t buy into the hype in the targeted ads. Save your money. This product is not worth half the price I paid for it. Finally, if you have any sensitivity to scent you will not like this product. It smells like I’ve put honey on my face! And I can smell the lingering scent throughout the day.

The box and product was a lot smaller than I thought but it is called mini for a reason! The lip tints are super cute as well as the box it comes in. the lip tints themselves have a nice coconut smell to them and the color intensifies depending on how many layers you put on✨!

Just got it and only used it for 3 days, but it's suuuuper cute! The case is adorable, love that the stains are in mini little tubes and good variety in the colors. Pretty good stain left on the lips. The colors are very flattering on Asian skin tones, used it on me and a friend.Will probably come back to update review after prolonged use.* Update: used for 8 hours where I went outside, reapplied sunscreen, and ate lunch and a snack. Lip stain performed AWESOME! I felt like if I didn't eat, the color would NOT have budged an inch.

This set is a really good value because it’s less than $10 and you get six different Colors of tints. However, the quality is not going to be comparable to some of the more expensive brands you find at most beauty Retailers. The tints are kind of sticky when they first come on however, this will eventually Stop after the first hour. The tints themselves range in colors between more natural and a more vibrant, red color, so you do have a decent variety of color all of which can be blended into be a more natural appearance. The Container they come in is adorable and perfect to keep them in, So you can think of it as a bonus item. They don’t last a super long time, so you will have to retouch them Throughout the day. The bottles themselves are quite small, but if you like to blend them in a little does go along way. This kit would be great for a kid or teen starting out with make up, As it isn’t too expensive for a gift and the shades aren’t too bold. Overall, though, they are fun to play around with, and if you want to start using tints and don’t have a ton of money, these are an option

The packaging is great and very cute, but the marketing for product is not very accurate?It should be described as a water tint.The ease of application isn’t great just because you have to scrape off the applicator so much to get a tiny amount so the colors can shine.There isn’t any smell I could pick up.The texture was actually pretty nice. When you use a very small amount to get the colors to match then it dries down and feels pretty light weight, not sticky, and skin like.This is absolutely a layering product. You’d need a gloss or lip oil to go on top- with this you could use a higher shine chapstick as well if you like the feel more. The lip stain doesn’t stay dewy and glossy after the first 10 minutes.Just to be clear for everyone this isn’t a peeling lip stain, it isn’t a dewy lip gloss. It’s an apply a small amount and let sit then put a top gloss.I think this could be a good product with better instructions, marketing, and tags for searches

Stains are great and natural and spreadable but the case and one stain had cracked because of poor shipping from the Amazon warehouse since it was packed with other heavy items and not properly padded.

I really enjoyed the texture of the lip stick/tent, but it was a lot more brighter pigment than I expected. I prefer dark cherry tones instead of some of the more bright tones. The application was great, and felt like water almost. They are very pigmented, and a few of them did have some stickiness, but not to the consistency of a lip gloss or oil. They are smaller than expected, but I prefer something small. They’re easier to carry.  And the smell was not strong, but didn’t take on the strawberry smell or anything that I expected

### Review: NYX PROFESSIONAL MAKEUP Jumbo Multi-Use Face Highlighter Stick - Vanilla Ice Cream#### Rating: ★★★★☆ (4/5)I recently added the NYX PROFESSIONAL MAKEUP Jumbo Multi-Use Face Highlighter Stick in Vanilla Ice Cream to my makeup collection, and it has quickly become one of my go-to products for achieving a radiant glow.#### What I Loved:**1. Super Creamy Texture:**The first thing I noticed about this highlighter stick is its incredibly creamy texture. It glides onto the skin effortlessly, making application a breeze. The formula is smooth and blendable, allowing for a seamless, natural-looking highlight.**2. Versatile and Multi-Use:**This highlighter stick is truly versatile. While it works beautifully on the high points of the face such as the cheekbones, brow bones, and the bridge of the nose, it can also be used on the eyelids for a subtle shimmer or on the cupid's bow for an extra pop. Its multi-use capability makes it a fantastic addition to any makeup bag.**3. Gorgeous Shade:**The Vanilla Ice Cream shade is stunning. It has a beautiful, pearlescent quality that adds a luminous glow to the skin without being overly glittery. It's perfect for both daytime and evening looks, providing a soft, radiant finish that enhances your natural beauty.#### Areas for Improvement:**1. Staying Power:**One thing to note is that this highlighter is not very long-lasting if you tend to rub your face. If you accidentally touch or rub your eyes, the product can come off quite easily. To ensure it stays put, I recommend setting it with a light dusting of translucent powder or using a setting spray.**2. Packaging:**While the jumbo size is great for ease of application, it might not be the most convenient for precise highlighting in smaller areas. However, using a brush or your fingers to blend can help achieve more detailed application.#### Final Thoughts:Overall, the NYX PROFESSIONAL MAKEUP Jumbo Multi-Use Face Highlighter Stick in Vanilla Ice Cream is a fantastic product for achieving a radiant, dewy look. Its creamy texture and beautiful shade make it a pleasure to use, and its versatility adds extra value. Just remember to avoid rubbing your face to maintain its gorgeous glow throughout the day.If you’re looking for an easy-to-apply, multi-functional highlighter that delivers a lovely, luminous finish, this one is definitely worth trying.

Ok whatttt i am actually so shocked this worked!! i was a bit skeptical when buying this at first bc it was rly cheap and no one added a pic of how it turned out when adding water, but i’m surprised it didn’t break!! I added some facial mist into it and cucumber (to spice it up a bit) which was actually such a good decision!! I’ve been used to icing my face with ice cubes only so this was a lottt easier. A tip i would like to add tho is that once it’s fully frozen, def run it under water especially the part with the hole bc that is where it gets kinda stuck, then instead of pulling it off, just twist it gently and then it gets easier to remove without breaking anything. Such a great and affordable product def recommend! 🫶🏻

I bought this as a gift, so can't comment on actual use. However, I have several oobservations worh mentioning...The plug for the water hole at the top is not attached with a strap, so I'm afraid it could get lost in a short period of time. When I squeeze the empty item with the water plug inserted, air escapes around the plug. I suspect that if this were tipped over before freezing that water would leak out. Propping it upright in the freezer so it can't tip over would solve this issue. The heart shaped stone is pretty and smooth as glass and is what sold me on this for a Valentines Day gift. This also can work as a small ice pack, which is handy with a toddler. No instructions or labeling of any kind came with this item to explain what it is or does, and I expect there will be questions. I copied and printed all information from the item description to include with the gift.

I'm very impressed with this Elf concealer.  The color is perfect.  It blends right into my skin tone, covers and conceals my dark undereye shadows all day, while appearing flawless and virtually unnoticeable.  No need to ever go back to a more expensive product that didn't have nearly the staying power and coverage of this Elf Camo Concealer.  It is very easy to apply, a little goes a long way, very much a ""less is more"" type of product.  It has that just-right consistency and applys smoothly. I would highly recommend to anyone.

The e.l.f. Hydrating Camo Concealer in Deep Chestnut is a standout product with its lightweight, full-coverage formula that provides a satin finish. It effectively conceals, corrects, and highlights while hydrating the skin, making it ideal for all-day wear. The 0.20 fl oz size is perfect for targeted application, and with 25 shades available, it offers a great match for various skin tones.
"

I am a big fan of most e.l.f. products.  This looked like another amazing product I did not try.First, the applicator is amazing.  It is a big soft pawlike sponge. it is so big, you need to make sure you only apply a tiny bit ..a little goes a long way.I only use a small amount under the eyes.  It  is ok. not the most moisturizing and tends to crease a little more than other hydrating concealers. The color is also more warm than I would like.  more of an orange tone than a pink tone, at least on me.  I purchased the Fair Beige.I do love to use this on a large sun spot on my face as the applicator is large ,  it covers the spot well under makeup and lasts all day.  So I would purchase it again for that use.

Truthfully, this concealer is amazing (especially considering its price!).For reference, I usually only wear Rare Beauty’s eye brightener to cover up my dark circles on the daily. It doesn’t completely conceal them, which is the look I usually go for. I don’t like looking cakey or completely different than how I look without makeup, so the eye brightener is my go to. However, it’s rather pricey, so I wanted an alternative for at least some of the days when I wear makeup, and I would definitely say this product is great for that. It costs a fraction of the price, and it offers a lot more coverage. It is fairly moisturizing, and it stays put for a long time. I only use the lightest touch of it to avoid my aforementioned concerns, meaning it is lasting a lot longer too.In short, I use the eye brightener for really chill days or days when I am running late, since it is super easy to apply. While on days that I have more time to do my makeup or I want to look ever so slightly more put together, I will use the elf concealer.100% recommend for anyone that would like to cover up their dark circles without breaking the bank.

I love the elf brand products because they offer the same quality that high-end premium products offer. I am a former professional make up artist and are usually use only premium make up brands. For example, some of the brands that I have are make up forever, Mac, Lancome, Christian Dior, Trish McVoy, Bobby Brown, and the Sephora brand. I love finding make up that works, and that changes the way you feel. Most cheap brands of make up the ones that you find at the drugstore don’t offer the same smooth and glowing appearance that a premium brand does. I have never bought concealer from the drugstore. I would find that the concealer would either be too thick and application was difficult due to the fact it would end up looking cakey, would not blend smoothly so you could see the parts that I applied it too so much that it was very obvious that I had makeup on, it wouldn’t offer full coverage or even coverage that could hide imperfections such as redness around the nose and or dark circles. The color options at the drugstore were limited or were not good for someone who has yellow undertones. It would offer beige, pink or dark undertones but they were never similar to a real skin tone. It would either be too light or too dark or have too much beige. I have scarring on my face and body. The scars usually required me to apply thick, cakey, concealers that rubbed off onto clothing, gave skin a plastic fake looking appearance and difficult to apply. They also were expensive and I always had to reapply them during the day because they rubbed off onto everything. This concealer is waterproof (I can take a shower and it doesn’t rinse off, I can get into the water and swim and it doesn’t budge, it is sweat proof, lasts 24 hours, is the only concealer I have found this year that I can use on my body and it doesn’t transfer to my clothes. The fact that it is TRULY transfer proof is such a huge solution for me as I can now apply it to my scars on the chest and neck and arms and I have never gotten any stains from it. I can rub it with my hands, use a cloth to see if it rubs off it doesn’t. It does require a makeup remover because it’s almost semi permanent and requires special cleansing to remove completely. You need to have a concealer brush that is high quality to use for application because it will apply very thickly if you use the included sponge application brush. It dries almost immediately so you need to start with very little product and carefully layer it so that you don’t over apply. It is not a concealer that offers a completely, natural, no makeup look. I have yet to find one that does. But this concealer does exactly what it’s advertised to do. It is cheaper than most drugstore brands but when you research best makeup brands ELF is consistently on the list as a brand that offers designer, premium quality products, that mimic and even beat the premium expensive brands. What’s great is that you can rely on the entire product line to cover all your makeup needs. I can go to Walgreens, skip the multiple aisles of drugstore makeup brands (don’t even have to look at the new makeup featured) I just go to the ELF aisle. I am able to buy concealer, mascara, eyeliner, blush, eyebrow pencil, eyeshadow, makeup removers, makeup brushes, and it offers a good selection of primers that you can experiment with. I am able to spend under $100 and be able to put together a huge makeup kit. When I lost my huge, expensive special makeup kit (I have different kits for certain situations) I was so upset. I had spent over $600 on the makeup in that kit, I had makeup that I saved up for and most of the makeup was $50-$150 dollars per item. I had spent a ridiculous amount of time researching, saving up and trying out all the makeup in that lost kit. I also had a huge event I was attending where I was going to be photographed and representing a new business. So I almost skipped going because I didn’t have time to get a professional makeup appointment (realized the kit was missing a few hours before event) no one was available on such short notice (Ulta, Sephora, Nordstroms makeup brand selections were all required to be booked in advance (I tried MAC, Christian Dior, Lancôme, Jean Juarez salon, Ulta in store makeup appointments were the same ) so I had to go to the drugstore for makeup or beg my mom to let me borrow hers. I went to store. I had read reviews from (makeup Alley, Ulta, new beauty & Allure to name a few, regarding drugstore makeup products that were as good as premium makeup) Elf was mentioned multiple times. So I went to the aisle and bought multiple options of concealers (3 different colors) all of the primers, 3 shades of blush, two mascara types, eye makeup remover for waterproof mascara, makeup remover for facial skin, and then I got a concealer brush, angled blush brush, foundation application brush, makeup sponge that could be used for all areas of face, eye lash curler. I couldn’t believe how cheap the makeup was (it is like Wet N Wild pricing but should be considered underpriced for the quality you get) my husband was really annoyed and concerned when he saw how full my cart was, I filled up an entire basket. He said it’s going to cost me $300 at least. Then I said let’s see. Went to the register and we both left the store in shock because I probably had purchased products that were worth $400 (yes makeup can easily add up to that amount especially when your buying all new stuff) but it cost us $120 dollars and we purchased over 20 items. I am hoping you try the concealer it is so cheap you can’t afford not to buy it and I recommend buying a few different shades of the concealer because you can mix them to match your skin tone perfectly and our skin color changes during the year. So try it! It’s a safe bet.

Arrived quickly and in good condition.My granddaughter's skin tone is pale and as such, she has a hard time finding the right shade of concealer.Leave it to Grandpa to know that Elf has everything a gal needs. I saw this 'fair warm' concealer, and having no knowledge of makeup save for self education, decided to buy it for her to see how she liked it.Oh my, was she happy with it! It was exactly the shade she's been trying to find for awhile now, and couldn't believe that I, a 'dude', could pick the right type of makeup for a gal.I told her that Grandfathers have super powers that no one knows about until you yourself become over sixty and let her ponder that as she happily applied her concealer and realized that Elf just gained a new customer for life.

I'm very impressed with this Elf concealer.  The color is perfect.  It blends right into my skin tone, covers and conceals my dark undereye shadows all day, while appearing flawless and virtually unnoticeable.  No need to ever go back to a more expensive product that didn't have nearly the staying power and coverage of this Elf Camo Concealer.  It is very easy to apply, a little goes a long way, very much a ""less is more"" type of product.  It has that just-right consistency and applys smoothly. I would highly recommend to anyone.

The e.l.f. Hydrating Camo Concealer in Deep Chestnut is a standout product with its lightweight, full-coverage formula that provides a satin finish. It effectively conceals, corrects, and highlights while hydrating the skin, making it ideal for all-day wear. The 0.20 fl oz size is perfect for targeted application, and with 25 shades available, it offers a great match for various skin tones.

I am a big fan of most e.l.f. products.  This looked like another amazing product I did not try.First, the applicator is amazing.  It is a big soft pawlike sponge. it is so big, you need to make sure you only apply a tiny bit ..a little goes a long way.I only use a small amount under the eyes.  It  is ok. not the most moisturizing and tends to crease a little more than other hydrating concealers. The color is also more warm than I would like.  more of an orange tone than a pink tone, at least on me.  I purchased the Fair Beige.I do love to use this on a large sun spot on my face as the applicator is large ,  it covers the spot well under makeup and lasts all day.  So I would purchase it again for that use.

Truthfully, this concealer is amazing (especially considering its price!).For reference, I usually only wear Rare Beauty’s eye brightener to cover up my dark circles on the daily. It doesn’t completely conceal them, which is the look I usually go for. I don’t like looking cakey or completely different than how I look without makeup, so the eye brightener is my go to. However, it’s rather pricey, so I wanted an alternative for at least some of the days when I wear makeup, and I would definitely say this product is great for that. It costs a fraction of the price, and it offers a lot more coverage. It is fairly moisturizing, and it stays put for a long time. I only use the lightest touch of it to avoid my aforementioned concerns, meaning it is lasting a lot longer too.In short, I use the eye brightener for really chill days or days when I am running late, since it is super easy to apply. While on days that I have more time to do my makeup or I want to look ever so slightly more put together, I will use the elf concealer.100% recommend for anyone that would like to cover up their dark circles without breaking the bank.

I have tried so many brands of concealer include all other brands of drug store products up to Tatcha’s concealer, paying more than I wanted to just to find something that worked for me. This is full coverage. It isn’t drying and the color selection is great. It goes on smooth and the qualify is fantastic. I will purchase again.

The product is nice and covers well but the color just was a no go for me. I am very pale so I ordered what I thought would be the palest color but it's very peachy undertoned and I am not so It looks patchy on my skin. I think it's better to buy these types of things in person.

I love the elf brand products because they offer the same quality that high-end premium products offer. I am a former professional make up artist and are usually use only premium make up brands. For example, some of the brands that I have are make up forever, Mac, Lancome, Christian Dior, Trish McVoy, Bobby Brown, and the Sephora brand. I love finding make up that works, and that changes the way you feel. Most cheap brands of make up the ones that you find at the drugstore don’t offer the same smooth and glowing appearance that a premium brand does. I have never bought concealer from the drugstore. I would find that the concealer would either be too thick and application was difficult due to the fact it would end up looking cakey, would not blend smoothly so you could see the parts that I applied it too so much that it was very obvious that I had makeup on, it wouldn’t offer full coverage or even coverage that could hide imperfections such as redness around the nose and or dark circles. The color options at the drugstore were limited or were not good for someone who has yellow undertones. It would offer beige, pink or dark undertones but they were never similar to a real skin tone. It would either be too light or too dark or have too much beige. I have scarring on my face and body. The scars usually required me to apply thick, cakey, concealers that rubbed off onto clothing, gave skin a plastic fake looking appearance and difficult to apply. They also were expensive and I always had to reapply them during the day because they rubbed off onto everything. This concealer is waterproof (I can take a shower and it doesn’t rinse off, I can get into the water and swim and it doesn’t budge, it is sweat proof, lasts 24 hours, is the only concealer I have found this year that I can use on my body and it doesn’t transfer to my clothes. The fact that it is TRULY transfer proof is such a huge solution for me as I can now apply it to my scars on the chest and neck and arms and I have never gotten any stains from it. I can rub it with my hands, use a cloth to see if it rubs off it doesn’t. It does require a makeup remover because it’s almost semi permanent and requires special cleansing to remove completely. You need to have a concealer brush that is high quality to use for application because it will apply very thickly if you use the included sponge application brush. It dries almost immediately so you need to start with very little product and carefully layer it so that you don’t over apply. It is not a concealer that offers a completely, natural, no makeup look. I have yet to find one that does. But this concealer does exactly what it’s advertised to do. It is cheaper than most drugstore brands but when you research best makeup brands ELF is consistently on the list as a brand that offers designer, premium quality products, that mimic and even beat the premium expensive brands. What’s great is that you can rely on the entire product line to cover all your makeup needs. I can go to Walgreens, skip the multiple aisles of drugstore makeup brands (don’t even have to look at the new makeup featured) I just go to the ELF aisle. I am able to buy concealer, mascara, eyeliner, blush, eyebrow pencil, eyeshadow, makeup removers, makeup brushes, and it offers a good selection of primers that you can experiment with. I am able to spend under $100 and be able to put together a huge makeup kit. When I lost my huge, expensive special makeup kit (I have different kits for certain situations) I was so upset. I had spent over $600 on the makeup in that kit, I had makeup that I saved up for and most of the makeup was $50-$150 dollars per item. I had spent a ridiculous amount of time researching, saving up and trying out all the makeup in that lost kit. I also had a huge event I was attending where I was going to be photographed and representing a new business. So I almost skipped going because I didn’t have time to get a professional makeup appointment (realized the kit was missing a few hours before event) no one was available on such short notice (Ulta, Sephora, Nordstroms makeup brand selections were all required to be booked in advance (I tried MAC, Christian Dior, Lancôme, Jean Juarez salon, Ulta in store makeup appointments were the same ) so I had to go to the drugstore for makeup or beg my mom to let me borrow hers. I went to store. I had read reviews from (makeup Alley, Ulta, new beauty & Allure to name a few, regarding drugstore makeup products that were as good as premium makeup) Elf was mentioned multiple times. So I went to the aisle and bought multiple options of concealers (3 different colors) all of the primers, 3 shades of blush, two mascara types, eye makeup remover for waterproof mascara, makeup remover for facial skin, and then I got a concealer brush, angled blush brush, foundation application brush, makeup sponge that could be used for all areas of face, eye lash curler. I couldn’t believe how cheap the makeup was (it is like Wet N Wild pricing but should be considered underpriced for the quality you get) my husband was really annoyed and concerned when he saw how full my cart was, I filled up an entire basket. He said it’s going to cost me $300 at least. Then I said let’s see. Went to the register and we both left the store in shock because I probably had purchased products that were worth $400 (yes makeup can easily add up to that amount especially when your buying all new stuff) but it cost us $120 dollars and we purchased over 20 items. I am hoping you try the concealer it is so cheap you can’t afford not to buy it and I recommend buying a few different shades of the concealer because you can mix them to match your skin tone perfectly and our skin color changes during the year. So try it! It’s a safe bet.

I recently bought the Cq acrylic Makeup Organizer and Storage White Skin Care Cosmetic Display Case for my 12-year-old daughter, and it's been fantastic! The sleek design adds elegance to her vanity, while the three clear drawers offer ample storage for her makeup and skincare products. It's durable, versatile, and keeps everything organized neatly.

This organizer gave me back a good amount of counter space. Everything is easy to see and the pull tabs for the drawers are easy to install and surprisingly sturdy.

Makes all your makeup nice and orderly.

I like the color Rose You Slay. It helps keep a dewy look but isn't shiny. I'm 57 & so many powder blushes just look dry. This one is so pretty!

This product is super watery, and it spills literally everywhere. Even with the lid on, it spills. Keep it upright and only if you love bright colors, super noticeable colors, then this is for you.

This mimics designer liquid blush I’ve used before, for a tenth of the price! It’s light weight and gives my face the perfect amount of color and shimmer! I’ll never use another product for blush- my husband who never used to comment on my make up, tells me often when I wear this, how “beautiful” my face looks on these  days.

This is my first time using Korean beauty products. I had a skincare routine using mostly Cerave and other drugstore products. I knew I needed to find something different when my skin continued to break out and I had no healthy glow. So I decided to take a chance on Anua.First of all, I've never had a problem with my skin not being soft. My main problems are continuous breakouts on my forehead and chin area as well as redness under my nose and dull looking skin. I start my routine with this pore cleansing oil. I was skeptical at first because...oil? On my skin? But it smelled so good that I decided to give it a shot. I use just one pump and I massage it on my face for a good couple minutes. After using this for a couple days I did notice my skin was softer and starting to look healthier, but I new I was still missing something. So back to Amazon I went and I got the Anua pore cleansing foam.After using the pore oil, I rinse and follow up with the Anua pore deep cleansing foam, which also smells nice and clean. I lather it up and massage it on my face while paying special attention to my problem areas. After rinsing and patting my face dry, I can already see such a difference with my skin. After a few uses I was getting some glow back and the redness was fading.I decided to add more Korean products to my skincare routine and since Anua, I have also added BHA exfoliating toner  pads and Madagascar centella ampoule. The BHA pads I use directly after the Anua pore cleansing foam. They have a softer side and a rough side for when you need some extra scrubbing. They smell like tea tree oil, which I don't have a problem with but some people do. After using these I pat my face to let the product soak in. Then I follow up with the Madagascar centella ampoule. This stuff is non scented and must be milk from the heavens because oh my goodness. I thought my face was glowing before using this but after? I look like I was kissed by the morning dew. Seriously face has never looked so healthy. It's soft, it's glowing, I'm very pleased.My takeaway from using these products is this: give them some time, but for me it didn't take long! I've been using these for maybe two weeks now and I no longer have painful redness under my nose and I haven't had a breakout either. My skin is soft and dewy and wonderful which I noticed after just a couple uses. I am also starting to see my pores look a bit smaller. I'm pretty happy with my switch. I hope you will be too!

I'm so just an FYI I only used this 2 times since I just got it!...however I am soooo freaking shocked!!! 😨😨Ok little back story, I have always had acne prone skin, had to go on Acutane when I was younger, it was that bad. I am now an adult abd have the usual adult acne. I have been using Korean skin care stuff for about three months now. Within my new skin care routine I was using a korean cleansing balm as my 2 step routine for washing...BUT!!! I did not see what I saw with this Cleansing oil ( i should have tanepictures! 🤦‍♀️) ...now mind you I have watched like a dozen or so cleansing videos and I kept seeing all these little things come out of the people skin, like the little sebum looking things. AND HOLY MOLY THEY WEREN'T KIDDING!!! The crap that came out of my skin yesterday and today...😱😱Lord above, I honestly thought I was loosing my mind!So the texture is not as thick as the balm obviously, but I actually love that! No scent, and light weight. Skin feels soft after, emmolcifies nicely too.So yes I woukd recomend!

I have sensitive combination (oily and dry) skin. If I use a lot of normal cleansers it either stirs up my acne or rosacea or makes my skin dry. This cleanser is oil based and so gentle I can use it twice a day and my skin is glowing. I’ve been using this in combination with moisturizer and castor oil at night, and I have had people compliment my skin. I have less than half of my bottle left after about a month, and I may just reorder today so I don’t run out without having more. That’s how you know you love a product - when you start worrying about running out!
"

I bought this because of all the reviews saying you can actually see your blackheads , etc after using this, but I haven't seen anything. I use it for about 5 mins in circular motions and then add a little water to create a slight foam (not very foamy) as per instructions online. Then i wash off and cleanse my face with my regular face wash. My face does feel cleaner. I did get one large zit after the first time I used it but it could've been my face being extra clean and just reacting.

I got this product to add to my skincare routine to get rid of the subconscious filaments on my nose that I have tried to get rid of for years. Upon first use I can see the sebum bits on my finger tips. I love this DOWN!!! If I could use this everyday I would but recommend use only twice a week. After the first 2 uses I can see a dramatic change in the texture of my nose it’s so smooth.
"
506,"
I've used like a third of the bottle by now, and it's great for taking off makeup.For taking off sebum it works after a good 2 minutes of rubbing and has a good clean sweet mint smell.Does not take off all blackheads which is why people probably also get the ""ANUA Heartleaf Quercetinol Pore Deep Cleansing Foam, Facial Cleanser, for Double Cleansing, BHA, Hyaluronic Acid, Glycerin, Face Wash, Blackhead Remover, Korean Skincare"", I would too the next time I order off amazon.The label however gradually starts coming off due to shower condensation.

I was hopeful that this would melt the sebaceous filaments right out of my nose, which it unfortunately didn't like how some TikTok videos describe. It visibly shrinks them though which is about just as good, and is great for my combination skin. It doesn't dry me out, and doesn't leave me oily. It might still melt blackheads for others though, so i'd say it's worth a shot!

I have a lot of junk in my pores on more nose up to between my eyebrows and I've tried a lot to get rid of it. So far, this is one of the few things the actually works! You can feel the gunk being worked out of your skin and see it on your finger tips afterwards, just make sure to massage HEAVILY into dry skin. Really massage it in there.I have sensitive, dry, reactive skin, and this hasn't broken me out. I follow up with an exfoliating toner, and I am slowly getting rid of the ew.
"
509,"
I started out using this daily, which proved to be a bit too much for my skin. I started doing it 2-3 times a week and have seen better results. Super hydrating and relaxing to massage into your face. The fragrance isn’t too strong, and smells more medicinal which I enjoy. As for clearing pores, I’ve had better luck with other products BUT this one is the most gentle and I feel has definitely shrunk my pore size some!

My personal experiences with this product is only according to my own face, it won’t apply to everyone else’s. But to me, I have extremely sensitive oily acne prone skin. I repurchase this as a second bottom but I don’t really like it. It kind of burns my skin, I don’t know why?? But it’s just my skin. Blurs my eyeball out every time I use it but it really doesn’t clean out the oil and the blackhead on my disgusting nose 😭. I would recommend but not for sensitive girly

Well and truly obsessed with this balm. The stick is smaller than I thought but a little bit goes a long way, and it’s very easy to use. I love to put it on before bed, as my night time moisturizer. My skin feels so great in the morning! It does feel a little greasy as it’s soaking into your skin (which is why I use it at night and not in the morning), but once it’s all absorbed it is fantastic. I had a couple of lines (can’t quite be called wrinkles) beginning on my forehead, and this helped make them become less noticeable to myself. The smell is nice and neutral, nothing that would be potent or bothersome. Would 1000/10 buy again!

As a fan of Korean beauty products, I've always been intrigued by their unique offerings, and this one is no exception. With its impressive SPF50+, it not only offers excellent sun protection but also stands out for its ability to prevent premature aging and skin damage. I am a redhead, and its a BIG deal for me!One of the standout features of this balm is its convenience. The stick applicator, a practical and easy-to-use design, is perfect for on-the-go use. What's more, I have an oily skin and stick doesn't leave a sticky residue. The balm itself is incredibly moisturizing, leaving my skin and my lips feeling plump and hydrated.But the benefits continue beyond there. The balm also has a skin-brightening effect, giving my complexion a healthy, even tone. It's a perfect companion for sunny days, with a light, pleasant scent for hours.

I LOVE that this gives a soft dewy glow. It has a pleasant rosy smell to me. It does feel a bit sticky on my skin, but I only apply it to just on top of my cheekbones and if my collarbone is exposed. Once it has absorbed into the skin it feels soft and hydrated. Definitely will buy again!I wanted to come back several months later to add more to my review. The product is a good value for the money as it lasts quite a long time. I still have my original purchase. As I said before, I add it like a highlighter to add a bit of shine at the top of my cheekbones and collarbone. It is glossy and wet looking at first, but once the skin absorbs it in there is an effect of a glow from within. I've found when younger (gen x) we were pushed to make our oily teen skin look matte to appear more mature, but now that we are this recreates that youthful luminosity to the skin precisely where it is applied. I've also put this under my eyes and noticed a reduction in puffiness, but definitely apply it a bit before you need it to give it time to absorb.  I get compliments on my skin almost every time I wear it.

I bought this on Prime Day on a whim. I do not regret! I love that Asian glass-like skin. My skin loves it and it gives me dewy soft skin without it being greasy. It absorbs well and feels light. I live in Florida and the humidity here can be crazy and even so, it feels nice. I love using it on frankly cleaned bare skin to see that healthy glow. Buy it!!! I am ready to buy all the other ones! ❤️ For reference, first picture is no makeup on after skincare routine ending with the stick balm; second picture is using balm underneath makeup.

Si estás buscando un producto que encapsule simplicidad y efectividad en el cuidado de la piel, el KAHI Wrinkle Bounce Multi Balm es una joya que merece un lugar en tu rutina diaria. Este bálsamo coreano no solo ha conquistado mi neceser, sino también mi corazón por su versatilidad y resultados visibles.Lo primero que destaca de este bálsamo es su formato práctico y portátil. El envase en forma de barra permite una aplicación precisa y sin complicaciones, lo que lo convierte en un producto ideal para llevar en el bolso y retocar a lo largo del día, ya sea en el rostro, el cuello o cualquier zona que necesite un poco de hidratación extra.En cuanto a su textura, es rica y suave, pero sin ser pegajosa. Se desliza fácilmente sobre la piel y se absorbe rápidamente, dejando un acabado luminoso, casi como si te hubieras aplicado un filtro de luz natural. Lo que más me gusta es cómo revitaliza las áreas más secas de mi rostro, especialmente alrededor de los ojos y la boca, donde tienden a aparecer las primeras líneas de expresión.Hablando de líneas de expresión, después de usarlo regularmente, he notado una ligera disminución en la apariencia de las arrugas finas. Aunque no es un producto milagroso que borrará todos los signos de la edad, sí siento que ayuda a mantener la piel más tersa y con una apariencia más saludable. Además, es excelente como una base previa al maquillaje, ya que proporciona una hidratación duradera sin afectar la aplicación de otros productos.Un punto extra que me encanta del KAHI Wrinkle Bounce Multi Balm es su fragancia sutil y agradable, que añade un toque de lujo a cada aplicación. No es abrumadora, pero sí lo suficiente para hacer que cada uso sea una experiencia sensorial placentera.En resumen, el KAHI Wrinkle Bounce Multi Balm es un excelente aliado para quienes buscan un producto que no solo hidrate y mejore la apariencia de la piel, sino que también sea fácil de usar en cualquier momento del día. Si tu piel necesita un pequeño empuje de hidratación y brillo, este bálsamo podría ser justo lo que buscas.

AQUA BALM:I already have the multi balm so i decided to try the aqua balm in hopes to pack lighter for an upcoming camping trip. The texture is less greasy(not vaseline greasy but a little bit greasy) than the multi balm and leaves a powdery feel. It leaves no white cast and helps with hyperpigmentation. I like this product, I see myself using it when I'm out working or going to class. This brand is reliable so the price is no concern. The price is up there with brands sold at ulta and sephora. The balm will definitely last you a long time.KISSTIN BALM:I also purchased this one because it can simplify my makeup routine. If I want a little something but not have to pull out my makeup bag then I'll reach for this. For my skin tone it looks like I've been sweating so for the summer I use this only on the lips and during the winter and spring I'll use it on my cheeks. This will probably last longer than the aqua balm since you're using significantly less as the aqua balm is sunscreen and the multi balm is a moisturizer balm.Highly recommend if you're looking for something reliable as your first korean skincare product. Korean skincare never fails to show results. With proper use and time you'll see results come. I look forward to the future with these.

This will probably last longer than the aqua balm since you're using significantly less as the aqua balm is sunscreen and the multi balm is a moisturizer balm.Highly recommend if you're looking for something reliable as your first korean skincare product. Korean skincare never fails to show results. With proper use and time you'll see results come. I look forward to the future with these.

I didn’t have high expectations for this but i absolutely LOVE this highlighter. It’s so dewy and shiny and stays on all day. My friend even asked me what highlighter I was wearing
"
542,"
so I’m gonna start off by saying this is overall a really good thing to buy. so this product is definitely a dupe of the rare beauty highlighter but you definitely get your moneys worth and it’s a pretty good product considering that it’s a dupe, but one thing that I didn’t like about it is that even though I sealed it pretty tight it’s still spilled over my make up bag and it was a pain to clean up but other than that I feel like I recommend it and I hope you enjoy:-)

My daughter wanted the rare beauty liquid highlighter for her birthday. We went to the store numerous times. She tried it every single time. I just couldn’t justify spending almost $40 on a 14 year old for this make up. I found this dupe on Amazon. It is looks exactly the same. The applicator even is heart shaped on the bottom. The color is exact and consistency is exact. It wears exact as well. The dupe of the highlighter is next to the rare beauty blush on the left. I swatched on my hand but that picture does not do it Justice. ONLY DIFFERENCE IS IT DOES NOT SAY RARE BEAUTY. I recommend this to EVERYONE!

This blush and highlight is so good! Very pigmented and blends super nice.

I loved the color and pigment but I could not keep it for very long. Everytime the Formula would noticeably leak in my makeup bag and was not worth keeping

Definitely worth the money it’s the exact same as rare beauty blush & highlighter I will not be spending money on the real thing anymore this is it for me ! If you can see in my picture how well it works I definitely recommend

This highlighter has a really pretty glow and definitely could have been a keeper. However, I received these highlighters less than half full and very clumpy, almost used looking wands. I bought 3. As soon as I pulled the wand out, I could see the bottom of the bottles. Move around the wand and large empty spots on the inside walls of the bottle appeared as if the bottle was close to empty. :( I only swatched on my hand since the half full containers left me concerned about it's use.  I would have loved to keep them. They seem like they would be a good highlighter. Was excited about them being waterproof too.
"

But the highlighter leaks a lot but they are good rare beauty dupes

This is a very lightweight liquid highlighter. I love it! I use it on the days I do a full face of makeup and I put it all over my face after my moisturizer and before I put on my foundation. It gives a natural glow. I have used it on top of my foundation too and it looks really nice as well! Would definitely recommend! If you’re looking for something that’s super vibrant and bright this might not be for you because it blends in very nicely and can look subtle.

I have been using Cerave products for decades and they have helped me manage my various skin conditions: dry skin, sensitive skin, keratosis pilaris, and occasional breakouts. They are easy to find, effective, and fit in my budget.  Having said that, everyone's skin, preferences, and budget are different, so as a point of reference, I am a middle-aged woman who uses Retin-A which causes my skin to be sensitive and can be drying. I learned about double cleansing from Dr. Dray, a board-certified dermatologist, who has her own YouTube channel. I am a fanatic about sunscreen, and some types of sunscreen are harder to remove than others. The double cleanse method of using an oil-based cleanser followed by a mild cleanser makes sure all sunscreen, dirt, oil, and makeup are removed in a gentle, non-drying way. I have used different cleansing oils and there is one that I still buy and use regularly, but here's what I appreciate about Cerave Cleansing Balm:It's solid at room temperature, so it will travel well and not potentially cause a mess like an oil could.It's a small container (1.3 oz) perfect for travel and the container can be washed and reused when empty.A little goes a long way; it should last a long time if using the amount indicated - a pearl-sized amount.No irritating ingredients, fragrance, or essential oils.Has a very mild scent that does not linger and I do not find off-putting at all.Removes my stubborn sunscreen without scrubbing, irritation, or stripping all moisture.Rinses off easily without leaving a residue.Leaves my skin moisturized but not at all sticky, oily, or greasy.I follow up with the Cerave Hydrating Facial Cleanser and my skin feels plump and moisturized even before I put on any moisturizer.For people who say they thought the jar would be bigger, the amount of product (1.3 oz) is listed in the very title of the product and in the description, and the price gives the breakdown per ounce, so neither Amazon nor Cerave were trying to conceal the size. For people who say it irritated their eyes, the description clearly states, ""Avoid direct contact with eyes. If contact occurs, rinse thoroughly with water."" I know most of us don't have a lot of extra time, but it does pay to slow down and read a bit more closely. Currently the price has dropped to $9.47 from $13.99 which is $4.52 cheaper and a good deal for a quality product. I will definitely buy it again and again - especially at the lower price - and enjoy the results. Good luck!Update: This arrived on August 22nd and I used it almost every night. I used more than a pearl-sized amount  each time and it lasted until November 5th, so more than two months with every day use.

I am such a big fan of this cleansing balm! I bought this because I wear eyeliner and waterproof mascara almost daily and I was finding that I would have to wash my face 2-3 times with face wash in order to get the eye makeup off. This product works wonders on my makeup! It takes it right off without issue.The best part- it doesn't irritate my eyes! I usually get a bit in my eyes but it doesn't hurt at all. The only way I can tell that I got it in my eyes is because my eyesight is a little bit blurry between when I use this balm and when I wash with regular face wash (the face wash & rinsing with water clears my eye sight).One callout is that it works best if your face and hands are dry. I instinctively wet my face the first time I used it and it didn't work as well so I was skeptical. Once I did it on my dry skin then it worked like a charm. The product is silky enough so that it isn't irritating at all on dry skin. It actually feels kind of good and soothing.

I was looking for a more oily makeup remover due to the need to remove waterproof makeup and provide a more moisturizing treatment for my aging skin (46 years young). I used it by rubbing it into my skin, especially around the eye area, and then used a warm microfiber cloth to wipe it off. I should mention that I have very sensitive skin, particularly around the eyes. My skin tolerated this product well, and I did not experience any discomfort or reaction (especially in the eye region).The product works AMAZINGLY; I love how it removes all makeup and moisturizes my skin in the process. However, the smell is a bit off-putting. It has an artificial and chemical scent that I find unpleasant. Despite this, I will continue using it, especially during travel, because it is convenient and I prefer it to makeup-removing towels or tissues. I would recommend it because it works, but if you are sensitive to smells, I would advise caution.

I skipped by this product at first because a few reviews said it left an oily feel. It doesn’t. When you rinse with water the product emulsifies and rinses clean.I was looking for something gentle that would remove mascara and eyeliner. For years I’d used makeup wipes and they were fine, until they weren’t. My eyelids were becoming sensitive, dry, and irritated. I was unsure why, but started trying new makeup removers. None seemed to remove it without a lot of effort which made the irritation worse. I started using Cetaphil Hydrating Eye Gel-Cream to heal my eyelids, and it works great. But, couldn’t find a remover for months until I tried this Cera Ve balm. Here’s how I use it. Apply about a pea size blob on a super soft microfiber cloth. Rub it in to a quarter-sized circle. Gently wipe the mascara and eyeliner off. For me, it takes a minute per eye. Then I take another small blob, apply it to my forehead and cheeks with my fingers (no cloth), massage it into my entire face, then rinse well with water. Ta-Da! Clean skin that feels great! If I get any product in my eyes, I wipe my lower eyelids with a Q-tip from outer to inner corner. Then apply my favorite skincare. I love it! But, you need to try it out and figure your best application method depending on your makeup and skin needs. Forgot to mention, it has no odor. Great product!

I’ve used many different cleansing balms but this one is the first one to completely remove my waterproof mascara without any effort other than some gentle rubbing on my eyelashes.

I struggle to remove mascara at the end of the day, and I really can't afford brands like the Clinique balm. This is not only affordable, but it actually works. Yes, it's a small container, but I only needed a tiny amount of balm, so I can see this lasting me a long time. I gently rubbed it into my lashes, and SO MUCH mascara came off within seconds. I cleaned away the excess with a little micellar water on a cotton pad. No constant rubbing of my eyes. No mascara residue under my eyes the next day. It doesn't have a strong scent and it's such gentle product. I'm so pleased and will definitely buy again.

There needs to be an option for NO star! This product has ZERO stars from me! I was so excited to get new makeup! I opened it immediately! To my surprise it was very small the picture was a bit misleading but that I could have overlooked. I touched the eyeshadows and they were so hard I tried with a Q-tip to see color- nothing!  I guess I could have scraped the top to get some off to see the colors but I had opened a lipstick and it as well was so hard would not just have glided over your hand didn't appear to be moist or even usable at all. I was looking at each product that was there and if I’m honest I got to wondering “is this safe”? I guess you already know by now I sent it straight back! I did read a few reviews and it boggles my mind that some people liked it SO much and then mine was not usable and play-like almost 🙃. I am also a little disappointed that Amazon would allow such things to be sold under their empire but 🤷‍♀️ what do I know. Would NOT  Recommend! I do not like leaving bad reviews however I rely so much on them I felt I should say something because I truly feel this product was not usable and or safe-just my honest opinion.

The chapstick and the nude lip gloss were both kind of gritty feeling on my lips. Another thing I don''t like is that the lip glosses stain your lips a little bit and I know the eyebrow stuff is waterproof but like I  used two kinds of makeup remover to get it off . I used makeup wipes and makeup melting balm neither got it off. I had to use rubbing alchol to get it off !!! Everything else is good though some of the concealer kind of had a pinkish shade to them though . I love the concealer stick it matched pretty well to my skin tone and my skin tone is fair to beige . All the other stuff was really good . I love the eyeshadow .

This is a complete makeup kit, especially for novices like me.This kit is great for travel, since they are smaller in size but has everything. I travel often and I always feel like I should take all my cosmetics just in case I have a special occasion or outing, but that takes up a lot of room. I recently took this bag/kit, (not by choice but because I was running late for my travel and it was all I grabbed before leaving), and came to find that it had all I needed. Makeup for the day and evening or outing.It comes with everything needed to achieve a complete look.The color options of the shadow palette and the lipsticks/lip glosses are great, with a variety of colors/shades to suit all occasions.The lipsticks are creamy and don't dry my lips.The mascara has a small brush, which I love, and it does not cause allergies as some others do.The foundation is not my shade but I use it on some areas to highlight.The brushes are soft and do not lose any bristles when applying makeup.The products are great on my skin and the kit comes with everything needed and many color options.Overall, this is a good, complete kit that in my opinion is priced accordingly.

This lip stuff is the bomb! The applicator is nice & thick so you get a good coating in just 1 or 2 swipes! It makes my lips feel refreshed & hydrated while leaving them with a light glossy shine. Unlike some, it isn't sticky at all, which I especially like. I first heard about it & learned of it from the Today Show. They raved about it, so I thought I'd give it a try! So glad that I did! I love it.

I've only had this lip gloss for five days and you would have to pry it away from my cold, dead hands. I am IN LOVE with this gloss! It's not sticky at all, has a very mild smell (not an unpleasant one!), and the color is vibrant and exactly like the photos after just one coat. My lips don't feel dry after wearing this too - they feel so soft and hydrated! Literally don't see myself using any other lip gloss ever again, I can't wait to buy more of these in other colors now lol

It really nice! It appears to be so far since I've been trying it out to be really nice and it looks nice on me what I can see. It smells nice. Doesn't seem to have any funky weird smell, which is nice. I'm not sure what to take of the taste it your tongue does come contact to it it's not a nasty taste it does give like as it says the name oil kind of taste oily but. But it's not a bad one but it feels a bit different taste a bit different. When you're wearing it and drinking eating something you're consuming it meets contact with it you're going to taste it and it's not a terrible taste, nothing funky, which is nice. You can definitely feel it on your lips it's not super weighing down but if you apply it like I do I do at least two three coats and it has some weight to it but it's a smooth not super heavy not feathery light I guess but I don't quite know how to explain it a weight knowing that it's there but not a weighing down weight. It doesn't feel over oily or gooey, which is nice. It does look kind of gooey and sticky as you get it out just remember to shake it I forget to do that. So far for me it's been nice I don't know it's not terrible but I'm still unsure how I feel about it I like it but it's just kind of a more oily lip gloss, instead of a creamy like lip gloss more of what I'm used to and I really like so I still like it but it's feels kind of different weird than my usual what I like to wear. I got it on sale so for me it was definitely worth the money. All this makeup stuff's kind of pricey for me I just wear it for special occasions or just feel like perking myself up. Maybe doing a little sprucing myself a bit up I guess you could say. It's not terrible I like it but I'm used to it ignore creamy or gloss it is like it says in the name the more oily but not like oily watery oily there is some more thickness to it which I like. The price for it is not terrible but it's a little bit more pricey for my liking for what I got it for on sale I definitely would like to get it again but I have to wait until I have it but if it comes on sale again I would definitely purchase at least two or three of them!

This is a GREAT lip product, reminds me of Rare Beauty but less dry. This one WORKS, left my lips super soft & I like the pink undertone. I wanted to try a different shade, but went with this one and I absolutely love it! It’s a good travel size, fits in your bag & the scent smells of watermelon! Which is a plus. The price point is all too worth it! Definitely recommend, and there is a good amount of product in here that will last I’m sure a very long time! It is NOT sticky! Just glides on smooth! So happy with my purchase! Thank you Amazon, this one was hard to track down. None of my nearby stores had it!

This NYX lip oil is a fantastic find! It's super moisturizing, just like the Fenty lip oil, but at a much more affordable price.

These lip oils have become my go to for every day & even going out. I love the sheer pigment & how it gives you a subtle yet juicy lip. The applicator is pretty big but it is comfortable. I love how affordable these are since i tend to misplace my lip products. It glides on smooth & lasts a decent amount of time. Not sticky & it feels hydrating on the lips. The only thing i dont like is the smell/taste of these. It goes away in a short while but still unpleasant imo. Other than that the color payoff is great for a lip oil & they are very wearable. Would recommend!

Wow! I am OBSESSED! I came back to buy 2 more to have everywhere. I actually like this more than the name brand Black honey because they only have a sticky version and one that your lips always have to be super smooth and it does not last long. This color is universal and looks amazing on fair skin.  It is a very unique color. Very few other companies have successfully pulled off a good dupe. It is like a very deep midnight plum.  The ""chocolate"" is more a balance to the purple than a true brown. My husband makes a comment every single time I wear this. I have very fair skin. I highly recommend this. I hope they never stop making it.

I got this makeup organizer for my dorm room desk when I was going to be a freshman in college, and I am heading into my junior year in the fall, and I have no complaints about this organizer. It has two fairly sized drawers which I put my blush, bronzer, and highlight pallets in. One big drawer that I put my extra contact cases in, my actual glasses case in, more makeup pallets and some hair ties. Up front there are 3 medium sized containers, and in the back there are 3 large sized containers, and to the side there is a flat space for like perfume, or Aquaphor tubs. Overall I am really impressed with this organizer. Nothing has broke on it, it's super easy to clean, has a surprising amount of space and holds a lot. It's also easy to transport with your makeup and other things still in it.

I recently purchased the GAINWELL 50-Colored Natural Compressed Facial Sponges and I am absolutely thrilled with them! These sponges are a game changer for my daily skincare routine. Each sponge is wonderfully soft and gentle on the skin, making them ideal for facial cleansing without any irritation.What I love most about these sponges is how effectively they work to remove makeup and cleanse the skin deeply. They lather up beautifully with just a small amount of cleanser, which helps in conserving my skincare products. The variety of colors in the pack is not only fun but also practical, allowing me to color-code sponges for different uses or family members.Another major plus is their eco-friendliness and reusability. After use, they rinse out easily and dry quickly, maintaining their shape and texture even after multiple uses. This not only ensures that I am making an environmentally friendly choice but also offers great value for money.Given their quality, effectiveness, and price point, I definitely plan to repurchase these sponges and would recommend them to anyone looking for an efficient, sustainable option for facial cleansing. The GAINWELL sponges have truly exceeded my expectations and have become a staple in my beauty regime!

I have been using this for a few years, and I love it!  I hate the feeling of makeup on my face, but as I get older, I need something to even out my skin tone.  This does that without feeling heavy - I use this in place of foundation.  However, the last few tubes I have bought - the pump stops working!  I have returned them a couple of times, but it is a pain in the rear to keep doing that.  So - now I am trying to find something like this because I am tired of spending $60 on something that stops working.

This product has quickly become a staple in my skincare routine, and for good reason.After just a few uses, my skin feels incredibly soft and looks noticeably brighter. The serum effectively hydrates without feeling heavy or greasy. One of my favorite aspects of this serum is its refreshing citrus scent.I wholeheartedly recommend the Image Vital C Hydrating Serum to anyone looking to revitalize their skin. It's a game-changer that delivers on its promises, leaving you with skin that feels nourished, rejuvenated, and absolutely radiant. Trust me, this is one product that deserves a permanent spot in your skincare arsenal.My husband and I LOVE it!

When traveling, the product easily dispenses itself due to the design of the pump. It needs a more secure closure to keep the wonderful product in the bottle and not all over my travel bag.

I had been using this product since Apr 4, twice a day. I like how it moisturized my face, it is super light on your skin and I love the smell, my skin appearance is more lighter and the dark spot around my eyes is getting more lighter. And also I used it on my underarms and I’ve seen a good result.Overall the products works on me.  And I will definitely recommend this product to my friends.

This product has quickly become a staple in my skincare routine, and for good reason.After just a few uses, my skin feels incredibly soft and looks noticeably brighter. The serum effectively hydrates without feeling heavy or greasy. One of my favorite aspects of this serum is its refreshing citrus scent.I wholeheartedly recommend the Image Vital C Hydrating Serum to anyone looking to revitalize their skin. It's a game-changer that delivers on its promises, leaving you with skin that feels nourished, rejuvenated, and absolutely radiant. Trust me, this is one product that deserves a permanent spot in your skincare arsenal.My husband and I LOVE it!

Cute, the right color, and they are very soft. I did not use these as I gifted them in a prize basket so I am not sure about absorbency, but the person who received them, loved it. Very stretchy so I don't think fit would be an issue for most. Great little gift, but you can buy these on shein or temu for cheaper, just have to wait a little longer.

I bought this because my boyfriend is making a movie about an influencer so I looked up what they use constantly and this popped up. So far It has just ended up as personal use since the movie hasn't been made yet. I love it and it works great.

This little guy is a game changer.I have lots of zoom work meetings and for whatever reason, the software accentuates dark spots, acne scars, and raccoon eyes worse than in real life.This concealer has been helpful in boosting my confidence - a little goes a long way - and has simultaneously fought breakouts.I have very sensitive skin and it’s worked very well. The only blending issues I get are when I accidentally add a little too much.I do have to moisturize before adding, otherwise it can slightly dry my skin out. And then you get flaky texture obviously sitting on on your skin.

I am completely blown away by this concealer.  First of all, thank you Neutrogena for producing a yellow-based concealer.  This matches my complexion perfectly (I purchased medium 15).  I have tried a few concealers including MAC, which were not skin friendly - at least for me.  Then I've been using Murad's conealer for some time.  It is very good and stays on all day with a matte finish under powder.  However, the shades have pink undertones and it doesn't match my face like the Neutrogena concealer.  This one outshines Murad -  a BIG surprise given the relatively cheap price.  It also glides on smoother and covers blemishes and imperfections very well.  Moreover, even though it conceals so well, it is more lightweight than the Murad concealer.Even better, it blends so well that you do not necessarily need foundation.  I use it with Mario Badescu's Special Healing powder, topped with Maybelline Fit Me powder.  I have not tried the Neutrogena mineral powder as these mineral powders do not agree with my skin (despite their popularity).  I would consider the Healthy Skin powder be Neutrogena; but I fell in love with Fit Me.  It really does ""fit"" your complexion perfectly!  Anyway, I have also invested in one of the Neutrogena Skin Clearing foundation.  It is also the bomb!  Only use it when going out on the town though and maintain the abovementioned regime for day wear.It should definitely be produced in a wider range of shades though to cater to darker skin tones.  It's a great product and should be suitable for all of us ladies.  :o)Cheers

The texture and application of the product was fine. However, the colors offered did not work for my skin tone. If you have cool peach undertones the colors  may work for you.  I have light olive skin with yellow undertones and neither the light or medium worked for me. The other color offered looked too dark. I had to throw the products away. But I did eventually find almay offers colors in a blemish concealer that do work for my skin tone.

Here is what I have learned from using this medicated concealer.  It is not for everyone as it does have salicylic acid 0.05% in it which is what helps to clear the acne.  However, that is not why I tried it.  I have a problem with milia on my face, especially the nose and chin areas.  If you are not familiar with milia, it is small hard cystic like round ""things"" right below the surface of the skin.  Unlike acne or blackheads, they cannot be squeezed to get the contents out.  There is a tool designed to just nick the skin at the site of the milia and extract it.  This medicated concealer can be used then in a small amount to cover the area.  If all the milia have not surfaced, this concealer will ""draw"" them to the surface for gentle removal.  From what I understand, good exfoliation of your face will keep this condition managed.  While all people certainly do not have this problem, I unfortunately do.  So my experience is with this only.  I also have found that this concealer can be very drying and will cause peeling of the skin since I do use it 2-3 times a day right now.  But, I don't mind because I sort of need that action to get rid of the milia.  Otherwise, if you experience drying or peeling of your skin, cut back to once a day or every other day.  Also, as some have stated, it does not work that well for under foundation concealer as it can be very dry and will show through your foundation.  Bottom line, if you need a medication for acne or milia, this works great, and it serves as a concealer while it is doing its job.  Once healed, I will most likely switch to another concealer without this ingredient in it. I hope this has been helpful.

Great product. It works very well… but, packaging  sucks. Each time … I have about 1/6 of product left in the bottled container. Nothing you can do to pump the remainder out. You can knock it, shake it , and bang it. Product will not pump out. You can not unscrew it, and if you try to break it, you will get glass in the product. That’s dangerous and I advise against it.  For $20 plus tax for such a small bottle, we should be able to get it all. For this reason, and only this reason… until packaging is change to a plastic squeeze container, I will try other easily accessible products that give me All my primer .

The grip is amazing I’m more so silicone makeup so since this is water based in order to use i would have to let it rest for a minute but it still interacted well with my silicone products. Makeup didn’t last as long I feel because of the silicone and water layering but I feel the pay off would be amazing if I had water based products. Still useable with silicone tho because it’s just that good .

A very good primer if your skin isn’t sensitive. Gives a flawless finish to your foundation, and can even be used for under-eye concealer and eyeshadow.However, this gave me cystic pimples and I only used it a couple of times. I will still be using for eye makeup though!

Y’all, I wanted to love this product so badly, but after having tried it, I got the worst breakout. First off, I applied the hydro- primer and waited for it to fully dry before applying my moisturizing treatment. Because of the rave-reviews, and reading how this would really help hydrate and leave skin with a dewy look, I was all in. I even purchased the biggest size available, but gosh, what a waste of money. For me, it left my dry skin looking caked with makeup once it set. And the “dewy look” only made me feel like my foundation was not providing me the coverage I normally have, I felt like it took me having to apply more foundation on top of this, thus not giving me the true primer that I was hoping for. I suggest that if you really want to try the hype, buy the smallest size, actually see if it works for you. I figured I’d be saving money by buying the larger size, since I would use it daily, but on my second day, I was having breakouts, and felt like a teen again in my thirties! It just didn’t work for me at all and sadly, into the trash it goes!
"

I like it but for the price there are others out there that work just as well. My fault for not looking at the amount in the bottle and just never imagining the size being so small. It’s like a sample size for $20 bucks. That’s just crazy to me. I’ve actually gotten sample products bigger than this for free!! I’ll never buy it again for this reason only because I liked how it worked just not good enough to pay that price. I’ve used Ulta brand and it works just as good for $5. And you get more.
"

The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because you get such a small amount for such a high price. I wish I could afford to purchase this regularly but honestly I think the ELF brand makes a primer that’s very similar and a quarter of the price. I wish some of these higher end brands would make their products more affordable for everyone; if they did, I’d purchase those products all the time!

I'm super excited to report this works.  I'm an oily skinned woman in my early 40's who wears minimal make up daily, but I've had to rely on blotting my face with either blotting sheets or tissue 2 times a day to look fresh.  I slowly rolled the applicator all over my face after dinner and I couldn't believe how good of a job this did to remove the shine on my skin.  Don't get me wrong, it's not a miracle worker where I looked like I had just applied fresh makeup, but it did a great job.  I was noticeably less shiny with a semi-matte looking finish. I  did notice very slight transferring of my make up in the oiliest areas of my face (nose & forehead), but it was minor and could easily be touched up.  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone with oily skin and I love how sustainable, compact, and cost effective the item is.  I will be buying a couple more of these to stash at work and in my purse.  Glad I found this!
"

Tried it out as soon as it arrived.  It's works.  I hate carrying around blotters just because you have to use multiple and then you just hold on to the nasty little balls of oil until you find a trash can.  On top of that the cardboard packaging just never holds up.  I tried the roller as soon as I got it.  Amazing.  I have also carried around a Bare Minerals compact of their translucent powder.  The powder is great but the consistency is so soft and fine that the pan got annihilated just from being jostled around and covered my purse with powder.  Was super happy about that.  This roller is compact and simple.  Not sure how well it will do after months of use, but I'm imagining I can easily clean this.  Will update in the future.  Long story short I love it so far!

This is magic in a rollerball.  You roll it on your face and the oil wisps away.  Perfect for that midday oil buildup.  There is no chemicals, just a roller ball that takes the grease away.
