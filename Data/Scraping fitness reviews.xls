Very easy to use, set up and adjust resistance. Solid but portable. Primarily for chest, front delts and upper arms. Can be modified for biceps. It‚Äôs possible to do some behind the back stuff but that‚Äôs pretty awkward. It‚Äôs Exactly what I was looking for. Shoulder injuries limit traditional exercises like pushups for me so I am very happy to find this device to strengthen this area. I warm up on the 6-8 setting and progress to 10-12. There is a lot more potential resistance as I improve.I prefer this device to the much bigger and more expensive Bullworker for chest and shoulders exercise.

I like the idea that the screws are easy to get to and tighten if the arms get loose. The other device I purchased which is supposed to be a newer version has a cover over everything. I can't get it off since the screws holding it on won't loosen without stripping. So I just went ahead and bought this one. It feels very sturdy. I just used it for the first time. It is much more practical than the newer version. I'm getting in a good workout while I'm able to precisely set my resistance level in order to keep track of my progress. I'm wondering though how I can already be at notch 18 which is supposed to be equivalent to 400 Lbs. Maybe I'm stronger than what I thought. I am not massively huge. Oh well, anyway It's giving me an awesome workout. While people notice I'm building, I'm trying to keep it discreet how I'm doing It. Let'em think I'm going to the gym lol. I just don't know what I'm going to do once after I reach level 20(440Lbs). At least all the other exercises such as for back and biceps, and shoulders I don't need quite the max resistance, so I don't think that I'm going to outgrow the device anytime soon. As for how long the device will hold up, I'm not really worried about it. Probably at least 3 months. It's not really that expensive, so I figure I'll just buy a new one since the workout it gives me is all well worth it. Time will tell how long this one holds up. Think of all the hassle you would otherwise go through going to the gym and the money spent daily. This device is worth it even if you had to buy a new one every once in a while. Think about it lol!

I have only had this one day, but do like the feel of this piece of equipment. I feel that I can make upper body and core gains by using this is addition to other exercises. I am going to try and be creative and use this for thighs as well.

I actually enjoy using this for several sets every day in between working out with weights and resistance bands.  There are several ways to hold this and knock off sets.  As you progress with your strength you can adjust the dial for more resistance.  I always like to be able to feel a little burn in the muscles while using it... if I'm not feeling it then I dial it up a notch.  With it's small size I keep it along the side of the sofa and can knock out a few sets while my wife and I are watching a movie.  I've seen a few reviews saying that some people had some of the bolts loosen up or the cylinder start leaking fluid... mine has definitely not had either of those problems and I use it minimum of 4 to 6 sets a day. It's convenient, well made and a really good price to start working on your upper body muscle groups... watch a few videos and you will see the many different ways to use this. I highly recommend this no matter your skill level.

This works great,  I bought one for myself and one for my sister and my sister‚Äôs only use hers a few times and when she got it out yesterday, it‚Äôs leaking a lot if  oil from the shaft.Update: the seller contacted me about the above issue  and they will be replacing the product.

I thought one of the main functions of this was for bicep curls-which this is 100% useless for. It will only work your forearms not your biceps. It can be used for chest flys & if you face it backwards you can press it to the ground with 1 hand & get a decent tricep press but that's really about it. Very limited uses for this.

I can't beleive people would be out looking for this. But when you see it you notice simple things. It's adjustable and sturdy. It has a sharp and unique appearance. You can take it on the go with ease.. It does make some noise but not loud enough to bother anyone.. The grip and feel is comfortable.

This is great for a chest workout when you can't make it to the gym.  I'm an avid lifter, and I still feel like this goes up to a high-enough resistance for me to get a great workout.  The only thing is that it touts that you can also use it for arms or other exercises, and I've yet to figure out any way to actually do that.  But for just chest, it's great.

After having Covid 3 times, my lungs have a hard time while I‚Äôm working out. I was hoping this would really improve the strength of my lungs. I‚Äôm not asking for a miracle , just improvement. It has helped my habit of proper breathing to develop but it makes my mouth so tired that I dread doing it. The inside of my cheeks and lips just get so tired and the drool drips. Whether or not it would actually improve my lungs I can‚Äôt really say but lean toward - probably to at least some extent.
"
21,"
So, for what this is designed for, it works very well. You just pop it into your mouth as it shows in the product pictures and focus on breathing through your mouth rather than your nose. The air flow control is somewhat limited, but still offers a good enough range for progression. I don't have any issues with this version of the product, but I will warn you, if you're not used to it, you may end up over salivating while using it so when taking it out, have a napkin or something handy, and remember to wash between uses.
"

Used these during and they definitely help with breathing training. Would recommend for more outdoor type sports and training due to the fact if you drool, it will drop out of it. Kind of gross but it works lol the strength and difficulty is adjustable. Would recommend
"

It fits good, it does a good job... BUT...You end up breathing in quite cold air, it dries your mouth fast, but it creates extra saliva thats starts dripping on the sides.Not sure how this can benefit anyone. Sounds like good idea, but it's a little gadget that might serve you better than it serves me

My kids have been walking around like zombies blowing into these things in hopes that it will improve their soccer stamina. All I see is two dinosaurs with drool coming out of the sides of their mouth. I'm not sure how much longer I'll be keeping these around- they don't report feeling any differently after a week of use.

I both hate and love these things. I train often, and most times it's with a hypoxic mask -- you know, the elevation masks? I got used to that feeling after years of using them, so I decided to try these since they're supposed to do the same thing roughly.When I tell you these work, I mean it. Do NOT try to be a hero and adjust this to it's hardest setting and have an intense workout. You will literally feel it in your lungs. I'm telling you, I legitimately felt my lungs be sore from working with this. Take it slow.All I can really say without getting all scientific is that these work exactly as they're supposed to. And they work well.

First, the packaging is mediocre at best. The unit comes in 7 pieces, each in a thin bubble-wrap sleeve and all set inside a box. Second, I really cannot tell if all of the pieces I received are new, or re-packaged, or if they just appear pre-owned because they were shipped from China in less-than-ideal conditions. Anyway, they were not pristine looking, nor were they obviously used. The headrest looked brand new, so I went ahead and assembled it.Assembly is very easy. The pieces only fit a certain way. It took 10, maybe 15 minutes tops. Once assembled the unit seems sturdy. I gave it a try and did not feel any wobbling and everything stayed together.Using it is very easy. I am short and I agree with other reviews that it is quite a stretch to get to that top bar. I found myself holding on to the sides, lower down on the pads. You have to adjust your sit up to get a good crunch, but after a few tries I figured it out and definitely felt it in my abs. Also, the crunch is a very small, controlled movement which is great. You have to remember to let the unit guide the movement and not try to force a full-on sit up or you will be disappointed.I had to shave off half a star for the head rest because it really could be more comfortable without costing more. It just needs a better design. The other half-star reduction is for the packaging and look of the individual parts; there really should not be a question of everything being new.For $22 I think it is a really good buy. It provides good form for the crunch, supports my head and does not strain my neck and really allows me to isolate the ab muscles. If it lasts a full year of regular use I would happily pay $22 again next year for a new one.

Piece of junk!Poor build.Double screws in all areas except the top.Why not at the top too which is the pivot point for the entire device?One pic shows the ab roller on a perfectly flat level ceramic floor. The one side is almost 1/2‚Äù twisted higher than the left side.Assembly instructions a waste of time. How about stamping a letter or number on each part and showing on the instructions what fits what.One, of the two, longer hex bolt heads did not fit the enclosed hex key.The photo shows how most of the black foam is malformed.Look at reproducing the original (purple) ab roller.

I LOVE this bench it does almost everything I need it to do. I've had no problems with it and it was pretty easy to put together. It's very compact when you put it away and doesn't take a lot of space at all.BUT the leg extension leaves me a little worried. It works very well but the hinge on the leg extension has two grey plastic rings to help hold it in place and so the metal won't scrape together but it seems to be wearing down Everytime I use it. Also the padding on the feet area are a bit uncomfortable. I have to keep adjusting or i'd feel like I get blisters.The clip on the leg extensions hold the weights on there pretty good. Overall the machine holds up pretty well does what it needs to do and is pretty sturdy For the price I paid for it.... I'd say it's worth it.

I live. Full time in an RV and wanted a compact bench for a put away home gym. This bench is the center piece of that gym now.

It would be perfect if the seat moved forward and backward but that would mean it would cost $500 plus!  My legs are too short at the thigh to reach my foot under the lift. I hate straddling the front of the seat just to reach my feet forward. This is really made for guys with those long legs or some really tall woman. That‚Äôs the only drawback. Oh yeah! If you find some small broken piece of plastic sin the package, it‚Äôs probably from the seat adjustment bar. Mine was cracked but the ball pulls out fine without it. It just makes it a little difficult not to break a mail pulling on it to get it moving to adjust the seat. Also I would add some was on the seat adjuster bar too. Run a candle cause I guess until you‚Äôve used it enough to loosen it up, it‚Äôs kind of difficult like I said to move it.Otherwise, for the money, it‚Äôs built sturdy and is easy to assemble and I like that it‚Äôs not so heavy that I can‚Äôt move it when I need to. The rubber door helps a whole bunch so that it doesn‚Äôt move when exercising. It can hold some weight too cause I‚Äôm not a MISS sized woman. FULL BODIED works great with this thing too. üëç

I absolutely love this bench. It arrived today and I was able to set it up in enough time for my virtual session with my trainer. The set up was very easy. However there is a section of the bench that I‚Äôm unable to fit the bolt in. Thankfully it‚Äôs a section that isn‚Äôt in dire need of the bolt and will allow the bench to function as it should without it. I‚Äôm a 5ft girl so doing leg extensions and leg curls was difficult for me. As I you around with my workouts I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll be able to figure it out so I can do leg curls and extensions with ease. All in all, very happy with my decision to purchase. There won‚Äôt be any regrets what‚Äôs so ever.

Although the product arrived as expected, and it was good for the price, and easy to assemble, we were very saddened one of the feature did not work well. I didn‚Äôt expect my 14 year old to get hurt. The quality of the pulley system was not as expected. He was using the pull resistant feature and it ripped off and popped him in the arm and injured him. So the feature can no longer be used. But the reaming ins still excellent. The company and seller read her out later after my review and offered me a full refund for the issue. I appreciated the professional response.

I‚Äôm a physical therapist and my son just wanted a simple exercise bench to use at home for overall strengthing but I bought him this instead. Great product and good price.  I chose this so he can also work on his legs especially his quads. I bought the weights separately, but this bench comes with 2 removable resistance bands and adjustable back rest. And it‚Äôs sturdy.

This weight bench is one of those items you get, realize the quality could be better, but decide to live with anyway because it's too bulky to return. That was fine, of course, until it outright broke and I ended up falling on my butt!First, let's talk about using the bench. It's functional for basic exercises like dumbbell bench presses. You can adjust the backrest angle for more support during exercises like dumbbell curls, and it'll work‚Äîjust fine.However, the bench doesn't lay flat, parallel to the floor. Instead, it has a slight decline that can't be corrected by adjusting the backrest. You just have to accept that it's always going to be a little off, which is frustrating but manageable.Then there are the attachments: the leg press and preacher bench. The preacher attachment is practically useless‚Äîit's too narrow to use with a preacher curl/EZ curl bar. As for the leg press, it's actually painful. The shin pads offer little padding, making it uncomfortable. ""No pain, no gain""? This is the wrong kind of pain.Now, for the incident that really sealed the deal: this morning, during my last set of leg presses, the bench collapsed under me. The leg press weights slid forward, and the bench slid back, sending me to the floor. Luckily, I got my legs out quickly enough.After this experience, I came back to Amazon, hoping to get some money back for this sad excuse for an exercise bench, only to find that no options are available. So, I'm writing this review to warn others. Save yourself the hassle and avoid this bench.

Got it today and it was almost already assembled. I'm 240 lbs and it was solid under my weight. The padding on the bench was good. I'll be Chuck Norris camper in no time!

If your using this as a bench it's great it's held up both me 220 and my husband 300 for over a year of frequent use. However the leg piece was remove immediately due to how flimsy it is. If your adding light weight it's fine but anything over maybe 25 lbs I wouldn't. Since we can't use it to our full potential it was removed. Later the curl pad was removed as well because it's simply smaller than comfortable use demands. The bench itself pairs great with a smith machine or brench press bar.

It just makes it a little difficult not to break a mail pulling on it to get it moving to adjust the seat. Also I would add some was on the seat adjuster bar too. Run a candle cause I guess until you‚Äôve used it enough to loosen it up, it‚Äôs kind of difficult like I said to move it.Otherwise, for the money, it‚Äôs built sturdy and is easy to assemble and I like that it‚Äôs not so heavy that I can‚Äôt move it when I need to. The rubber door helps a whole bunch so that it doesn‚Äôt move when exercising. It can hold some weight too cause I‚Äôm not a MISS sized woman. FULL BODIED works great with this thing too. üëç

I absolutely love this bench. It arrived today and I was able to set it up in enough time for my virtual session with my trainer. The set up was very easy. However there is a section of the bench that I‚Äôm unable to fit the bolt in. Thankfully it‚Äôs a section that isn‚Äôt in dire need of the bolt and will allow the bench to function as it should without it. I‚Äôm a 5ft girl so doing leg extensions and leg curls was difficult for me. As I you around with my workouts I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll be able to figure it out so I can do leg curls and extensions with ease. All in all, very happy with my decision to purchase. There won‚Äôt be any regrets what‚Äôs so ever.

Although the product arrived as expected, and it was good for the price, and easy to assemble, we were very saddened one of the feature did not work well. I didn‚Äôt expect my 14 year old to get hurt. The quality of the pulley system was not as expected. He was using the pull resistant feature and it ripped off and popped him in the arm and injured him. So the feature can no longer be used. But the reaming ins still excellent. The company and seller read her out later after my review and offered me a full refund for the issue. I appreciated the professional response.

I‚Äôm a physical therapist and my son just wanted a simple exercise bench to use at home for overall strengthing but I bought him this instead. Great product and good price.  I chose this so he can also work on his legs especially his quads. I bought the weights separately, but this bench comes with 2 removable resistance bands and adjustable back rest. And it‚Äôs sturdy.

This weight bench is one of those items you get, realize the quality could be better, but decide to live with anyway because it's too bulky to return. That was fine, of course, until it outright broke and I ended up falling on my butt!First, let's talk about using the bench. It's functional for basic exercises like dumbbell bench presses. You can adjust the backrest angle for more support during exercises like dumbbell curls, and it'll work‚Äîjust fine.However, the bench doesn't lay flat, parallel to the floor. Instead, it has a slight decline that can't be corrected by adjusting the backrest. You just have to accept that it's always going to be a little off, which is frustrating but manageable.Then there are the attachments: the leg press and preacher bench. The preacher attachment is practically useless‚Äîit's too narrow to use with a preacher curl/EZ curl bar. As for the leg press, it's actually painful. The shin pads offer little padding, making it uncomfortable. ""No pain, no gain""? This is the wrong kind of pain.Now, for the incident that really sealed the deal: this morning, during my last set of leg presses, the bench collapsed under me. The leg press weights slid forward, and the bench slid back, sending me to the floor. Luckily, I got my legs out quickly enough.After this experience, I came back to Amazon, hoping to get some money back for this sad excuse for an exercise bench, only to find that no options are available. So, I'm writing this review to warn others. Save yourself the hassle and avoid this bench.

If your using this as a bench it's great it's held up both me 220 and my husband 300 for over a year of frequent use. However the leg piece was remove immediately due to how flimsy it is. If your adding light weight it's fine but anything over maybe 25 lbs I wouldn't. Since we can't use it to our full potential it was removed. Later the curl pad was removed as well because it's simply smaller than comfortable use demands. The bench itself pairs great with a smith machine or brench press bar.

Ever since I have began doing yoga, I have desired  above all, the ability to do a handstand.  This eluded me for years.  I read about this product in a book, and thought I had to try one.It is incredible.  Easy to assemble and very solid.  The first time I tried it, I was able to do the elusive handstand!  I was concerned about stability, but that turned out to be for nothing.  The unit is very stable and secure feeling.  And I am 6'02"" and 225 lbs, have a bad back, two metal knees, and zero natural balance.

I previously bought and returned two cheaper benches which had missing parts, were scuffed and dinged from manufacture and didn't fit together at all. This Feetup bench is recommended by yoga journal for a reason; it is well manufactured (in Europe, apparently) and is way higher quality.The pieces are all perfectly machine-cut and the bolts are better quality than the cheaper versions, which are soft metal that was in danger of getting chewed up by the Allen wrench (so possibly weaker!!!) The Feetup bench also has rubber feet screwed into the bottom of the legs, the cheaper versions I purchased had stick-on felt pads or nothing at all. The Feetup bench is not going to slide!The Feetup bench comes with lots of literature, a big poster and a neat little cardboard phone/tablet stand that hooks onto the crossbeam so you can follow a yoga class on your phone. Not a deal breaker, but all the literature and nice packaging confirms that this is a high quality item, not just a jumble of parts dumped in a box in China, as my previous purchases most definitely were!Relieved to finally have the right yoga inversion bench.

I love this inversion table so much I bought one for my office.  I find that it makes my neck and back feel great after sitting long hours. I like to do crunches on it upside down, but I haven't tried the full range of exercises listed on the poster. I just use it for relaxation and enjoyment and to reduce fatigue from sitting. I cannot believe how sturdy it is. I can fall over backwards (sort of into a back bend) and it still doesn't tip or move from the ground. I highly recommend. Though it seems a little overpriced at $200, for the simple materials its made from, it is excellent quality.

Best purchase I‚Äôve made in years!  Pretty pale pink band with gold accents is true to what it looked like on Amazon.  Very pretty and soft silicone band.  Also in the package is the manufacturer‚Äôs email and if you email them they will send you two additional watch bands of your choice.  They have three different texture options in many colors to choose from.  When you email them, you qualify for their lifetime warranty and if you have any issues, you would work directly with them through the email.  I am very impressed with them for such a cheap/affordable product only $39, they really stand behind it.  This watch is amazing, it is very easy to use & it has many face display options. Simply hold down on the face with your finger and it will bring up all the options.  Scroll left and right then you select the one you want by touching it.  So easy to change the face.  I have included some pictures showing you some of the face options.  I hate using things that are complicated and this is so easy. I absolutely love it! It comes with very easy to follow instructions, and it tells you how to download their app.  I installed the ‚ÄúDa Fit‚Äù app on my iphone and I can go on my phone to check my blood pressure or heart rate, or I can simply swipe to the left on the watch to find the option I want and touch it to take my blood pressure, oxygen levels or heart rate directly from my watch. It also gives me notifications if I get a text message or phone call or if I have an alarm set, my watch will vibrate.  There are also three alarms that you can set from their app. That is really nice because I now use the app alarms to remind me when to take my medication. So now I have three daily alarms on the app and four daily alarms I can set on my iPhone, which gives me a total of seven alarms per day to remind me to get up in the morning for work, clock into work, clock out of work, alarm to remind me when my lunch break is over, and when to take medication.  I really like that it tracks my steps too because we are recording these for my employer. I went into the ‚ÄúDa Fit‚Äù app under settings and have linked it to Strava directly through the watch app which was super easy.  Strava communicates with my employer, so it records all of my steps from this watch automatically without me doing a thing.  We are doing a fitness challenge at work, so this makes it really easy to participate. My favorite thing is how easy it is to use. All you do is swipe left to see all of the different options like blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen levels, steps, fitness, and even sleep quality.  You can sleep wearing the watch but overtime it might make your wrist sore so I try to only sleep with the watch on every other night instead of every night.  I find it very interesting that I only have quality sleep for under two hours per night because I move around a lot while I‚Äôm sleeping which prevents me from getting a quality rest, which explains to me why I‚Äôm tired every day. This watch has really given me insight to my health issues.  Compared to all of the other fitness watches out there that cost hundreds and do the same thing, this one is a wonderful deal, beautiful and very affordable!  I actually own an Iwatch but I prefer this one because it‚Äôs easier to use.  I highly recommend this product to everyone I know!

I've had mine for about a month now and unlike the last smart watch I purchased, I'm still wearing it.It's smaller than most smart watches and doesn't look obnoxious.  It has what I would consider a very clean appearance.What it does vs. what I expected it to do:  It doesn't do 'continuous' heart rate monitoring.  The shortest interval you can set in the app is five minutes, so if you're looking for something that can perform as a wearable ECG, you'll need to look elsewhere.  Also, though I find the app pretty good overall for a Chinese electronics device, there is no way as far as I can determine to export any of the health data.  You just have pretty graphs or charts to look at inside the app.Since everything above seems more on the negative than positive side I'll go ahead with the device's other caveat--I do not have any faith in the accuracy of the blood oxygen sensor.  It always returns 97-99 for me (usually 98-99).  My finger meter is usually 94-95.That being said, I do believe the heart rate sensor and the blood pressure sensor are both pretty accurate.  My blood pressure generally runs from baseline normal (120/80) to upper end of normal (140/90) and this device consistently reports as such and rises and dips based on how much stress I'm putting on myself.Oh, also the pedometer is probably as accurate as virtually any other wearable device you can get.  I've counted off and checked against it a few times and it's accuracy is always in the upper 90 percentile range.The battery life is great.  I switched it to not wake the display unless I press the button and I've charged it once (a few days ago) in the past three weeks, and that is with the five minute heart rate monitor option.Overall five stars for the value of this device.  Great looks, great battery life, mostly good sensor performance, and an easy enough app to use though I hope they continue improving it and give us an option to export data in the future.

I was looking for a watch that would measure my blood pressure, related to some concern for health issues that run in my family. I wanted to be able to take it as needed at my convenience. I read the reviews prior to making my purchase, and the endless scroll of 5 stars was enough to me. I was also excited to see that there were other features that I was looking for, like sleep tracking, bluetooth connection with your phone, heart rate monitoring, and step counting. The watch arrived overnight and in great condition. The instructions were easy to follow. It came with the charging cord that was needed, and the app that pairs with the watch is aesthetically pleasing and easy to navigate. The only downside of the app is that the numbers don‚Äôt seem to match up. When I was putting in my height and weight, the app added about 10 inches and 10 pounds. So to set my weight at 160, I had to set it to 150. Not a big deal whatsoever for the reason I purchased the watch, but still something to keep in mind. The watch arrived just as pictured, and the color combination is adorable. I love the pink band with the gold watch. However I personally am not a big fan of silicone watch bands. It makes me feel claustrophobic. I was thrilled as I was unboxing the watch and saw a card that provided an email address to reach out to for a warranty and 2 free watch bands in different materials. I reached out, and their customer service has been AMAZING. They even offered free wireless earbuds. This is the most satisfied I have been with a purchase in a LONG time. I love my new watch, and I love this company. Thank you!!

Seems to be fairly accurate when tested against other devices. For example the BP reading are pretty close to the cuff device I have. I only gave 4 stars because of the charging. Unlike most watches I've had it does not alert you when it HAS to be charged and then it takes at least 2 hours - more if you want it at 100%. And you cannot look at the app to see how far along the charging is unless you disconnect the watch from the charger first.Maybe I got spoiled with my amazfit watch it lasted 6 or 7 days, warned me when it needed charged and fully charged in about 40 minits. I switched because I wanted the BP feature and regularly timed heart rate readings. Overall I feel I got my moneys worth but taking it off for over 2 hours to charge kinda sux especially every 3rd day.

I'm 49, this is the first smartwatch i've ever owned. I specifically bought this watch to monitor my blood pressure and other vitals. The watch is performing great. It was easy to set-up, easy to link to my Iphone. You can actually customize the watch and all the settings after downloading the app, all the changes take effect on the watch. Screen display is great, touch screen great, multiple formats to choose from. Watch feels solidly built with a very comfortable soft touch band. For what I paid, options this watch offers compared to other smart watches on the market this is a no brainer. I'd recommend this watch to friends and family. My wife and 17 year old daughter want one now and they're Apple fanatics. Someone commented that this watch doesn't keep track of your hear rate all day, it does in fact, you have to adjust the frequency under setting on the app on phone. I have mine set to check every 2 minutes all day and the HR is in fact displayed. Also, make sure you have the right face selected that shows heart rate. Accuracy of the blood pressure is in line with my home monitor, so it does work. It records all readings in a chart on the phone app, this is helpful for doctor visits.

I wouldn't even think of depending on the readings for blood pressure or oxygen. I originally thought that the sleep tracking was just stopping randomly in the middle of the night, but I discovered that the glitch was in the app and the watch was operating properly. Tapping the watch and then using the app again yields the correct sleep tack. Still, it is handy for steps, weather, generally ok for sleep tracking, and alarms, plus it's cute and cheap. I haven't tried the camera or phone/text notifications.

When a different name brand fitness tracker stopped displaying my info after only 4 months of use, I decided to try this one. I have been very happy that I did. It appears to be fairly accurate with its HR, BP (which I have double checked with a separate arm unit) and O2 sat. When I received a replacement for my other faulty tracker, I wore them for several days to compare and I have chosen to continue to wear this one. It is attractive and cost less than 1/3 the cost of the other tracker. The only drawback is that it must be very sensitive when I am on the lawnmower...it racks up lots more steps than I am taking then. Maybe the bumpy lawn or maybe it picks up on my arm movements, I don't know. But I would definitely choose this tracker again.

Since I‚Äôve had some health problems of late, I really like being able to do my vital signs everyday.  I like that I have so many choices on the face of the watch.  Passed waterproof test as far as washing hands frequently had no effect on the watch.  The band color is pretty in pink.  I work nights and the watch couldn‚Äôt figure out I was asleep during the day.  So disappointed on tracking my sleep which was a big reason why I wanted the watch.

Kind of disappointed in this product. At first i got it to try because ive seen similar products being shown on youtube and thought itd be fun. When i first took it out of the box it was very loud and obnoxious, it makes the cheap action movie sounds when people get punched. *POW* *BANG* . There is no option to turn the sound effects off. even after turning on bluetooth you can hear the puching sounds over the music.The lighting ques do not synch with the music either so youre punching in different timing. After accepting that this probably isnt the product for me i thought hey maybe our toddler (almost 5) would enjoy hitting it. Unfortunately you have to hit it with the strength of an adult to hear a childs sound effect.

It's a fun idea but doesn't work quite like they advertise. You have to hit the board pretty hard, which the only problem is rolling your wrist if you don't hit it just right.

These are actually really cool machines for keeping you active. From kids to the elderly, it is a great option. It does not require too much pressure to register a punch. So, anyone can use the machine. The speed is even adjustable so you won't get bored as you advance.  The machine itself is well-made, out of foam like material, and is very easy to install. You can install it on almost any flat surface easily, with Velcro. There is also a massive double sided sticky pad on the back, if you would like to permanently attach it to your wall. They have included plenty of Velcro, so you can attempt to hang it several times.  The only reason I took a star off, is because unlike other versions of this machine, there is no battery in it. It is not rechargeable. It Has to be plugged into the wall at all times, so keep that in mind while installing.  Overall, this is still a really cool product. It does work exactly like it is supposed to, and can put up quite a bit of abuse. Soft, and safe, for anyone. Highly recommended.

Be careful where you place it though as thin doors wouldn't be the best location.

Overall, this is a super fun boxing machine!  I was honestly pleasantly surprised by the quality.  The machine itself is nice and sturdy.  The bluetooth speaker is actually pretty decent quality as well for you to play your music through as you work out.  It also has a built in default song if you don't want to use the bluetooth speaker.  As other reviews have said, the lights don't go with your music, but I expected that.  There are several different modes of lights that you can use, and you can adjust the speed of the lights changing as well.  I thought that it would make some sort of sound or keep ""score"" as you hit the lighted pads, but it doesn't and really just lights up to give you a frame of reference of where to hit.  The adult sized MMA gloves that it comes with are really nice quality.Only taking off one star for a few reasons:- There is no option to screw it onto the wall, it just comes with velcro adhesive strips.  I feel like it would be sturdier if you could screw it onto the wall.- The USB power cord it comes with is not very long and plugs into the side of the machine instead of the bottom, so it's hard for it to reach the outlets.  It also does not come with a power brick, so you have to use your own.- The children's red boxing gloves it comes with are very small and it looks like the set I got may have been used already as there was white fuzz stuck into the velcro.Overall though, I would certainly recommend this fun product!

Keep a screw driver and crescent wrench handy if you intend on using for high reps. I do up to 2000 reps daily. Some days lower reps higher weight resistants. Building some good strength up and intending on continuing this workout until I‚Äôm healed from surgery.IF YOURE JUST SITTING AROUND GET THIS MACHINE IT WILL CHANGE HOW YOU FEEL AND HOW STRONG YOU ARE RAPIDLY. START ON WHATEVER LEVEL YOU CAN DO 50 REPS THEN FIND THE LEVEL YOU CAN DO SETS OF 25 and do sets till 1000. KEEP GOING IF TOU GOT IT IN YOU. TRY AND GET AS MANY AS YOU CAN OTHER WORKOUTS WILL BE EASIER. ITLL MOTIVATE YOU TO DO BETTER ON OTHER THINGS BC YOU WILL FEEL STEONGER.

In going to be straight with you. This is my third arm strength exerciser thingy just like this one. The first one had springs and though it's ok, I don't like it very much. It's noisy and the bars are too close together.The second one was like this but had the electronic counter and I loved it. But it fell apart after a month.So my approach to this will be first impression, and then a how it's going and finally an I've broken this one too update.I've had this a few weeks now and I'm really liking it. I miss the electronic counter as I personally found that very motivating. But the hand grips are very comfortable and the bars spaced far enough apart that it feels like you are getting a good bit of excersise with it.The hydraulic is nice. It feels so smooth and easy as you squeeze the handles together. Now I've read about these leaking fluids. I manage about a hundred a day with this so we will see how long it lasts.One last thing for now. The settings are very easy to adjust, and I'm happy with that. All it is with this one, a simple dial you turn. I'm on 2.5 or so because I'm a big sissy weakling but it will be interesting to see how long I will be there before moving up a bit.Will update this later.Just a brief update here. It's still going quite strong with none of this hydraulic leakage, so far. I read that in some other reviews but happy to say no issues with it.One thing I did learn is that you want to go round every now and then and tighten the bolts. Phillips screwdriver and a pair of pliers does the job. Once the bolts fall out, one so far, they are a bit of a hassle to get back in again.I've moved up to 3 on the rotating scale thingy and it's much harder to do. So down to about 60 per day as opposed to 100.I've found it's building arm, shoulder, chest and ab muscles effectively.That's all for now. Will update again later.So I got this in June and we are now in September. Time to provide an update.It's going great for me. The bolts do need tightening fairly regularly. I've not experienced this dread leakage of the hydraulic fluid. In fact it's working great so far.I'm up to a three on the rolling scale thingy. My chest has expanded with use and abs have been developing too. This does help activate core muscles and that was unexpected for me.Really glad to have this and I hope it lasts a good while yet.

It works well but the screws like to come loose and need to be retightened and the product feels cheap. The dial has a sticker for measuring the level of resistance above it and that sticker was peeling when I got it. Cheaply made but a decent product.

UPDATEIt only took one day and now it has no compression, even when dialed up to setting 12. Save your money and get a different brand.ORIGINAL REVIEWI've been using a different brand of ""Hydraulic Arm Exerciser"". Yesterday it exploded when I compressed it because the bottom part was plastic (see photo). I already like this brand better because the plastic has been replaced with metal.This item arrived in one day, and I worked out with it tonight. I started with it on setting 8 out of 12, right out of the box. I do sets of 15 reps (see video). These devices will help you bulk up and even pump up your heart rate if you're doing cardio.This was also an excellent price, assuming it will last for a year or so. I got slack about working out recently and it shows. But I'm determined to get back into shape, and this device will be a key part of it!

I‚Äôm looking to gradually getting to doing more exercise this year, but I wanted an alternative to my preferred methods of walking or biking that I can do indoors when I am busy until it‚Äôs too late to walk or in inclement weather. This works great, because it is also extremely easy to watch tv while using this product, which helps encourage me to use it on days I‚Äôm feeling especially lazy.It works well, the links seem sturdy when clicked together and the ball is a decent weight. It takes a second to figure out how to use it; I‚Äôve seen a lot of reviews saying they have to put it on the shortest length not to hit anything, only the shorter it is the harder it is to make it spin. When the ball is out further it can use its own momentum to help it spin, which helps you get it to go faster. I have my string at the maximum length without issue; I stand in front of my tv just far away not to hit it and it isn‚Äôt low enough to hit the coffee table behind me. If you have rambunctious children or jumpy dogs this may be a problem and you‚Äôll need to find a private place to use it safely.I‚Äôve only used it two days for 30 mins each, and though I haven‚Äôt quite worked up a sweat I am seeing a similar calorie burn to when I go on my usual walks, which are typically about 1.5 miles and just under 30 mins. I‚Äôve found that if I can get it spinning good I can sometimes even lift my feet up, and if I can keep my hips twisting at the right rhythm it‚Äôs almost like running in place and I did get my heart rate up a few times. (Note that I‚Äôm overweight but not obese; if you have serious extra weight you would probably need to work up to that level of moving). I did already remove a link after just two uses, but rather than it being a miracle product I just figured out the best way to get the ball to move, which meant wearing it a little tighter so that is wouldn‚Äôt fall down to my waist as easily (I wasn‚Äôt necessarily wearing it loose before, but when the ball is moving quickly it pulls the band away from your body a bit, so you need to wear it a little tighter than you might think).The only potential issue I see is that it seems like the wheels on the internal track may start to wear down over time, especially since I‚Äôve been able to move it fast. I‚Äôve only used it a couple times so this is not quite a problem yet. I‚Äôm hoping this won‚Äôt become a huge problem, but if it does I will update.I‚Äôm hoping that as I continue to use it I can master the rhythm better and be able to get my heart rate up for longer. It is the exact same motion as regular hula hooping, but in my opinion more fun because I don‚Äôt have to stop to pick it up each time it falls, I just throw the string around my body easily if I lose the pacing and it drops. I don‚Äôt think it by itself will help me lose weight, but I am optimistic that combining with my walking and biking it will help me get in track, and mostly keep me accountable for the lazy days I don‚Äôt want to go outside and would rather catch up on my shows.

The box it came in was sturdy, with a  plastic insert holding everything together. I had no problems putting it together. Using it takes some finesse, my 15-year-old son can use it much better than I can. I‚Äôve seen in videos that you‚Äôre supposed to use it for 30 minutes a day but I‚Äôll definitely have to work up to 30 minutes a day. Today on my first day it was five minutes. It is a bit noisy, but I‚Äôve seen that another reviews so I expected it. It is wheels running on the inside of plastic so you cannot expect it to be silent. I was able to watch TV while using it. It was not so noisy that I could not hear the TV. Since I‚Äôve only had it for one day, I don‚Äôt think my review is any sort of expert opinion above and beyond that it came in very good condition, in a very good box and works just fine. About the longevity and quality of the materials, only time will tell.

Who knew I‚Äôd be a hula-hooper in my 30s! I have struggled with my weight my entire life and this hoop is truly helping me stay active and lose weight. I wasn‚Äôt able to do the recommended 30 minutes at first, but I worked myself up to it and did my first 30 minutes yesterday! It feels like a full body workout! My core is engaged, and I can feel it working in my butt and legs a lot! To get my arms more involved, I hold them out to my sides, in front of me, or above my head for as long as I can while I hoop. It‚Äôs much more fun than a treadmill, I promise you that. I can still breathe comfortably while I workout, but I am burning a wicked sweat! My heart rate is definitely up while I hoop!I am a teacher, and it‚Äôs been easy to use during summer vacation. I am looking forward to seeing if I can keep up when I get back to my normal work schedule.Overall, I‚Äôm so glad I got it! It‚Äôs easy and quick to put on. I don‚Äôt have to leave the house to use it, and that‚Äôs a big plus!Many people talk about how loud the hoop is when using it, but it‚Äôs plastic vigorously rubbing on plastic. The sound should not be a deterrent if you are serious about losing weight. I listen to music and start hooping! The time goes by quickly and it‚Äôs over before you know it!Update: I am three days shy of my one month trial of the hoop, and I have seen drastic changes in my body. Today, I took off my first link, equivalent to 2 inches. The hoop has been easy to use every day and I truly enjoy using it. I cannot recommend this enough.

It does take a bit of time to remaster the art of hula hooping but it‚Äôs a fun way to workout! I measured my waist to ensure I got the correct fit.

I was skeptical to get this. I‚Äôve read and heard countless stories that the weighted hoops that weren‚Äôt the band name one were not good.

So don‚Äôt get discouraged if you can‚Äôt get it consistently going at first. I‚Äôve had mine for I think like a month. Still don‚Äôt have it down 100% but I get better every time I use it/ haven‚Äôt had any issues with the weight or the wheels. And I haven‚Äôt had any problems with it falling apart when I‚Äôm using it. I like that I can do something to get my heart pumping a bit.

I bought this after a friend let me try hers. It seemed like a good workout with less twisting than a traditional hula hoop, which is great for me since I have had herniated disc issues. I'm not quite up to 30 minutes a day yet, but have gotten to 20. I've had it for about 3 weeks now, and still haven't used it consistently enough to see any results,  but it is a fun workout. I usually do it while watching TV. There is a noise factor to consider, I have to increase the volume on the TV to be able to hear it while using it, but it's not a problem. So far, I like it a lot, just need to develop a habit of daily use to see results. I just shared the link with a friend, who is interested in buying one. It's well made, simple to assemble and use. I recommend suspecting the links in like you think ot should go rather than trying to follow the instructions, they can be a bitconfusing. If you look at the links that are already connected you can pretty much figure out how to add  or separate the links.

The Daphne Ab and Arm Belt is an interesting piece of equipment. It looks sleek and futuristic, which is pretty cool, but getting it to work was a bit of a challenge. The instructions could be clearer; it took me a while to figure out how to turn it on.Once it's up and running, the belt gives you quite a workout. It feels like a firm, pulsating hug, which can be a bit intense but definitely makes you feel like you're doing something. I wore it to work, and while it was a bit distracting, I could feel it working on my abs and arms.One thing to note is the intensity levels. Level 1 is manageable and gives a gentle pulse, but level 5 is a whole different beast. It really ramps up the intensity and, to be honest, it hurts! It's like being pinched repeatedly by a very determined crab. So, if you're brave enough to go to the higher levels, be prepared for a serious challenge.Overall, if you're looking for a unique way to tone your muscles, the Daphne Ab and Arm Belt might be worth a try. Just be prepared for a bit of a learning curve and a lot of buzzing!

I recently purchased the Daphne ABS Stimulator, Ab Stimulator Muscle Toner and I am extremely pleased with my purchase. This device is a game-changer when it comes to toning and strengthening my abdominal muscles. The belt ia EMS effective and provides a comfortable and targeted muscle stimulation experience.I have been using it for a few weeks now and have already noticed a significant improvement in the tone and definition of my abs. The different intensity levels allow me to customize my workout to fit my fitness level and goals. The compact and portable design makes it convenient to use anytime, anywhere.Overall, I highly recommend the Daphne ABS Stimulator to anyone looking to enhance their ab workout routine. It's a quality product that delivers results in a convenient and efficient manner.I hope you find this review helpful!

I have atrophied muscles due to Arnold Chiari Malformation of the Brain. Any exercise that involves tensing up my neck muscles is very hard for me to do, it sets off extreme pain in my neck and head. I got this to try and begin to work my abs and arms and legs. For the price, I was not expecting a whole lot to be honest, but this WORKS. It will take a long time to get my muscles back to where they were before but this is a beginning. The intensity goes up a LOT. I did not need to use gel or water to get this to work, which is nice. And even if this stops working after a few months of using it daily, the low price will allow me to get another one to replace the used one. I should have gotten one of these a long time ago!

The DAPHNE Ab Stimulator & Muscle Toner comes with a waist belt, and two smaller belts for the arms or legs, depending on your size. The waist belt can be used on the legs as well, again, depending on your size. They are comfortable and easy to adjust. Each belt comes with a rechargeable adjustable ems snap-on that regulates the muscle contractions. There are many modes to choose from as well as intensity levels.I started using it while working, which is sitting in a chair at a computer. It was fine but but my arms would twitch involuntarily (upper arms are more sensitive and I had it on a high level), so I now wear them while I workout on the elliptical. It's the perfect match! I'm on week two and I can definitely see a difference. Honestly, you can wear these doing pretty much anything; dishes, housework, driving, walking, working out, standing, shopping, etc. You'll forget you're wearing them while you tone your muscles!Try them today!

Efficiency: From the first session, I could feel my muscles engaging in a way that mimicked a rigorous workout. The targeted stimulation not only worked wonders on my abdomen but also on my arms and legs, providing a full-body toning experience.Convenience: What truly sets the Daphne ABS Stimulator apart is its convenience. With a busy schedule, finding time for lengthy gym sessions can be challenging. However, with this stimulator, I can easily incorporate muscle toning into my daily routine. Whether I'm working, reading, or even cooking dinner, I can effortlessly wear it, allowing me to multitask without sacrificing my fitness goals.Comfort: I was initially concerned about discomfort or irritation, but the Daphne ABS Stimulator proved to be incredibly comfortable to wear. The adjustable intensity levels allowed me to customize the experience to suit my preferences, ensuring a pleasant workout every time.Results: The results speak for themselves! With consistent use, I noticed a significant improvement in muscle definition and tone. My abdomen feels firmer, my arms more sculpted, and my legs stronger. It's truly remarkable how such a compact device can deliver such impressive results.

I really wanted this to work well for me but I don't like it very much. I feel like it engages your nerves more than your actual muscles. Like little nerves twitches. I may be using it wrong but it's pretty easy to use so I doubt that. I'll try again and hopefully get better results...

Works as intended, but be careful! The directions are sparse to say the least (pun intended). Arm bands are designed for smaller people as is the belt itself. Too small for anybody that‚Äôs over an XL in pants. I‚Äôm close, but made it work.1. Make sure to use the water spritzer. The one provided is poor at best. Buy a small hand spritzer or mister - it makes a huge difference in conduction.2. The contact pads work well and the fact you don‚Äôt have to use replaceable gel pads is awesome.3. The electrodes (TEMS units?) basically have no instructions. They snap on and off easily and are easy to charge.4. It‚Äôs trial and error for which mode and intensity works for you. The later modes mix up the sequencing better, but watch the intensity levels. They can, um, surprise you with how strong the contractions can be.After a month of nearly daily use, the system is still going strong, but I had to replace the spritzer. There is a bit of fraying around the Velcro attachment areas, but that can be remedied with a clothing fuzz remover or de-pilling shaver. Be careful how much material you remove as it can affect how well the Velcro attaches. If it gets too thin, you could use an iron-on Velcro patch to extend its life.One thing did make me laugh while using the system. On your arms, if you get really good conduction on a rapid pulse mode, you will have NO CONTROL of your lower arms! Talk about ‚ÄúQUIT HITTING YOURSELF!‚Äù Absolute riot! Best laugh I‚Äôve had in months!

I really like how the abdominal belt works. It has an adjustable Velcro attachment that will fit a variety of sizes. I can feel my muscles moving as if they are contracting. The belt has a small attachment that you can use to change the mode and apply more or less strength to it.My problem is with the arm belts. They deliver painful shocks! Even when placed on level 1 and in all modes it is just extremely painful. They are not supposed to shock you.

I like these belts.  You can feel that they‚Äôre doing something to your muscles.  But if you‚Äôre a smaller person it‚Äôs not going to fit you.  I have about a 27 inch waist I think, and the ab belt is way too big for the Velcro to attach.  I have to pull it tight and sit down holding the belt against my abs.  The arm ones fit better.  I can even get them over my legs for a workout there as well although it‚Äôs a very tight fit.

I've used the abs simulator belt for going on two months.  Do I see or feel a difference?  Yes, I totally do not just in appearance but in physical strength as well. Now I am not going to say that I dropped 5 inches and 30lbs in the first two months, but there is a physical difference. One important thing is that you have to position the abs simulator to stimulate different abdominal muscles
