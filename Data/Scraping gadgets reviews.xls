I recently purchased the chopper, and it has completely transformed my meal prep routine! This chopper is an absolute game-changer in the kitchen. The quality of the blades is exceptional—they slice through vegetables with ease, making chopping quick and effortless. I love the versatility of the different blade options, which allow me to dice, slice, and julienne a variety of veggies with perfect precision.One of the standout features is the large container that catches all the chopped produce, keeping my countertop clean and organized. The non-slip base ensures the chopper stays in place during use, providing added safety and stability. Cleaning is a breeze too, as all the parts are dishwasher safe.The build quality is top-notch, and it feels durable and well-made. This chopper has significantly reduced my prep time, and I find myself eating healthier because it's so easy to prepare fresh vegetables. I highly recommend!

I saw an item like this on Facebook and wanted to try it. It works SO WELL! It's small enough to fit in my kitchen island, because all of the blades nest inside containers that fit inside the main unit. It's easy to put together, and the spring action makes dicing vegetables super easy. I have arthritis in my hands that makes chopping vegetables difficult for me, but this will make all the difference! I love that i can wash it in the dishwasher if I need to, but so far it's been easy to clean without that, because it includes a little gadget to clean in between the blades without touching them and then you can just rinse them with soap and water. I made a salad in just a few minutes. would definitely recommend it!

I am pleasantly pleased with this product! I do alot of cooking, and have a large garden that produces a lot of vegetables. I've developed arthritis in my hands which has made it difficult to keep up. I still have to do some cutting to fit the size of the chopper but it's significantly helped reducing the time and saves my hands. Cons: I wish the chopping area was larger. I also wish it had something on the bottom to keep it from sliding. Sometimes stuff gets stuck in the grid-like top of the chopperPros: It's sharp and cuts well. I LOVE that this one is dishwasher safe- many are not! It's easy to use. So far, it seems durable enough to withstand garden season. Comes with multiple options for different sized cuts/slices.

I am very happy with this item. I'm 80 and my hands are arthritic, so its a huge help. It does not do green onions very well as they get mushed in the grids and its takes less force if you cut your items smaller to fit depending on what you are cutting. It is very sharp, nicked my self first thing, twice, but I knew better. It cuts well and cleans up with a rinse under the tap. I think you just have to experiment with chopping different veggies to see what it can do. The trick is getting used to its capabilities. I am very happy with it and its a good investment.

Love this, saw all the TikTok videos showing these devices, after researching the different models and reviews, paid a couple more dollars for the original brand, as the cheaper models didn’t look as good.Very sturdy and well made, cuts potatoes and other foods with ease, stores easily. In a time when so many devices/tools are getting flimsier and cheaper, the quality of this, reminded me more of how things were made 30 or more years ago when everything wasn’t meant to be replaced every other year. Will make soups, casseroles, salads so easy.

The Mueller Pro-Series 10-in-1, 8 Blade Vegetable Chopper is a valuable addition to any kitchen, especially for those who frequently cook with fresh vegetables. Its multi-functionality, efficiency, and ease of use make it a great investment for saving time and effort in food preparation. While blade changes might require a bit of practice, the overall convenience and performance outweigh this minor drawback.

Chops great, I make a lot of salads or bowls with chopped vegetables. The Mueller Pro is fantastic. I have a tremor and using a knife can be precarious, this is a perfect solution. I have tried similar products in the past but was frustrated with how hard they were to use. This item is easy to use, speeds up to process of chopping, and clean up is much easier than a food processor. I highly recommend.

I needed an old school egg chopper like my mama used to have. This popped up on sale, so I decided to give it a go. (Bonus points for it being a product from a small company.) Honestly, for the price, I expected it to be kinda crappy, but I was surprised when I was proved wrong. This is delightful. The first thing I had to try was the tomatoes. I got stuck for a second, but if you kind of slide the vegetables and such in a left to right motion instead of straight, they slice beautifully with no issues. And my ADHD self loves that they are perfectly thin and all the same size. The slicer is extremely easy to clean.Next, I tried the onions. This one was a bit more challenging. Slicing worked beautiful, but dicing was a little difficult. I ended up having to quarter the onions and then chop them. The dicer plate seemed like it was going to break and I was a bit scared. It wasn't a big deal. The cleaning on the dicer was awful. It took me 3 or 4 washes to get all the onion out of it. So, I probably won't use the dicer for onions again.All over, I would recommend this to anyone who slices, chops and dices a lot. It's quick, efficient, easy to adjust, and (mostly) easy to clean.

I am a pet owner that loves to buy my pups Fresh Pet (fresh refrigerated dog food) but I’m also a cheapskate so I buy the rolls since they’re way cheaper than the crumbles. That means I’ve got to cut it up myself & I hate that. This is a dream for that purpose. I slice the roll, stick the slices on the grate (1-2 at a time) & press! Wahlaa! The sharp blade tray is a pain to clean by hand so plan on tossing it in the dishwasher. This used to take me forever but now it just takes a few minutes. Love it!

I have a Mueller inversion blender and trusted this brand already. I ordered two of these (one for me and one for my daughter) during Prime sales. I keep seeing these types of multi chopper/slicers on Instagram food accounts I  follow. I used it already to chop and dice mushrooms, onions, squash. cucumber, bell pepper, and tomatoes. I have not used the slicing/grating tools yet. “Wetter” foods like peppers, tomatoes, and cucumbers can be a little messy and not as easy to clean as “harder” foods. I am a very capable cook and just wanted easier prep of basics (and a fun new gadget). I also cry a lot when preparing onions and this helped do it faster and get I to the fridge or pan before the tears begin! I can’t wait to use it for potatoes. It’s going to make a soup recipe and home fries easier to make. I probably wouldn’t have splurged if it wasn’t discounted because I have a food processor.

This does not make a lot of popcorn. Think of it as single serving. It doesn't even fill one of the small paper popcorn bags, but that's fine. It pops quickly to make mulitple batches.You'll probably need two sets of times for this, the time for when it's just popcorn and the time for when there is butter in the top section. The butter drops as the popcorn pops, which makes it distribure evenly, which is wonderful, but which pulls away some of the heat. In my microwave, it's 2:30 just popcorn and 2:45 for popcorn with butter, to give you an idea. It's not a huge difference, but if I don't give those extra fifteen seconds, a lot of the kernals don't pop.That said, it's really consistent, and once you have your two times, you can just reuse them, no issue. Even if you do two batches back to back, the time is the same.It is critical that the turntable in the microwave actually be turning while you're using this, or the best case is the popcorn just won't pop. The instructions say it can damage that microwave. I lucked out, but ended up with a kettle of hot, unpopped kernals, save for two or three.My only complaint about this is it makes buttered popcorn so quickly, so easily, and so well I'm probably eating more of it than I should.

Pops great, only 5 kernels didn't pop.The smaller quantity the popper pops up is a good thing since my spouse doesn't eat popcorn. The melting butter in the lid was also a plus. My induction stovetop popper was not doing a good job. Our living room and kitchen are red, the assorted colors are are very attractive and you should be able to find one to blend with your decor. The design is creative, useful, and well done; the colorful plastic/silicone protects the glass and is very functional as a handle. Overall, great popper and serving bowl, it also cleans easily in the sink.

Product is perfect size for one hearty serving. Consistently pops all the kernels (assuming you don't overload it). Haven't had a single burnt popped kernel yet. The lid has holes for butter to melt through during popping; however, the butter melts completely before the popping starts, then pools at the bottom to become a dark brown coating on the glass (hence 4 stars rather than 5). Better to melt the butter separately and add it to the popcorn later.Plus, it's just darn cute.

There is nothing to dislike about this product. If you have burned yourself opening as hot bag of steaming popcorn and then finding your popcorn is burned? Those days are over! It takes a few minutes longer to pop than a paper bag but once it gets going you can actually watch the kernels. Important! Don't over fill or the popcorn will get kind of jammed together inside the container, and you'll need a spatula to loosen it up. The glass container doesn't  get dangerously hot like a paper bag does. The learning curve with this thing is very short. Always use the lid/cup to measure out your servings. The more butter you use the longer it takes to pop. Never stop and restart! Buy best quality popcorn! Cleans up easily! You will never use the paper bag again. This is the final word in popcorn makers.

I love popcorn! But I don't care for the microwave bags full of unhealthy additives. This is a game changer and it works beautifully. You have to monitor the first couple of times to make adjustments for your microwave. I did burn a little at first. But it is so simple and great! I bought them for Christmas gifts and made popcorn gift baskets with them.  Fresh popped popcorn is so much better & healthier than the prepackaged kind * I use mine all the time❣️🍿

So…I bought the larger model of this popper.  Instructions say to add 2 capfuls of popcorn and let it go until most of the popping dies down.  It ran for 3m 20s before I stopped it.The corn that had popped first was burnt.One cap would do fine, two caps just takes too long and that’s why I give it a 3.  Had I known this would be the result, I would have saved a few bucks and bought the smaller one.  As it is, I’ll be popping less despite the larger capacity so it isn’t burnt.The butter on the top, melting over the popping corn is ingenius by concept…less so in actual use.  The butter melts quickly and ends up in the pot before much corn has popped.  Some pieces benefitted but not as many as one would hope.The handle was cool to the touch coming out of the microwave and the popcorn poured right out into my bowl.  Better than 3/4ths of the corn was popped (more than even a bag).  I used a brand new jar of Orville Redenbacher’s to test.

I chose red, to go with my kitchen. I like the way it has a top that i can measure the popcorn, and melt the butter. It is just big enough for one cup of popcorn. Easy to clean. Very sturdy it pops quickly don’t have to wait too long. I would recommend it to my friends.

I love everything about this. I love that my popcorn is being popped inside a glass container (the only plastic being the tiny lid at the top). I love that it’s full proof. It pops my popcorn in three minutes, with about 10 kernels left unpopped. That’s a very good ratio. I love that I don’t have to pop my popcorn with oil anymore, making it a healthier snack. (I sprinkle cinnamon on my popcorn and just the tiniest smidgen of salt, so I tell myself it’s health food, LOL.) Anyway, this thing works like a dream. Perfect for a generous serving for one person (but I suspect for two people you might want two cycles with it). Just buy it, you won’t regret it. PS-I got the pale aqua color, which is really lovely, but there are lots of other colors as well. Whatever floats your boat!

With this microwave popcorn popper, I finally figured out how to pop my popcorn without burning it. Use water instead of oil or butter. That's right, water! I could never seem to pop my popcorn with oil or butter without burning it and end up having to throw it away.Put about 2 tablespoons of water in the popper (don't add butter or oil), add popcorn kernels to cover the bottom, place the lid on the popper, and place the popper in the microwave to pop the corn.I use the popcorn setting on my microwave, all microwaves are different so you will have to figure out how much time works for you. After your popcorn is popped you can add melted butter and enjoy.You're welcome 😁

First of all it's cute. I got the smaller one which is perfect for one or two people. You have complete control of the amount of oil and salt as opposed to microwave popcorn in the bag. The first couple of times I used the measure in the lid for the amount of kernels but then increased it because it only gave me a half of a bowl of popcorn. If you measure the amount of kernels by filling the lid it will give you a full container of popcorn. The silicone wrap around it takes the little out of the worry breaking the glass. The handle stays cool.

It's really cute.  Although because it's so compact, I could see how it might be a little challenging to open for some people.  If you don't want your small kids messing with it though, they may not be able to figure it out, so that's nice.I love the soft blades, so no chance of fingers being caught or hurt.  I really like the color, although I would have loved it in a deep purple too.Definitely does the job as I am a woman of a particular age 😊 and have hot flashes.  I also appreciate that it does have two speeds.  It's a welcome addition to my life.

I bought this little fan honestly because of the color, 😆 I was pleasantly surprised that while sitting pool side I was able to keep sweat off my face! This will be perfect for cruises! It’s not loud, it’s not heavy, it’s rechargeable, it packs just enough power that it won’t chop off your finger but you can pleasantly enjoy a nice steady breeze! Love that it came with a lanyard clip too! People said it was hard to open.. I had no issues as you can see in the video..

It works great for hot flashes. But you need it with you all the time. I was packing it in my pocket most of the time on our vacation. I didn't want to pack my purse with me everywhere, Its a little bulky for a pocket. (glad I had it) Small and powerful. Wouldn't have survived our vacation with out it.  Charge lasted all day and gose with me just about everywhere now.

Game changer experience! The Gaiatop Portable Hand Held Fan emerges as a versatile and efficient solution for those in need of a compact cooling device. Equipped with a USB rechargeable 2000mAh battery, this fan is designed for both convenience and performance.  One of the things I love is that it fits comfortably in a purse, tote or backpack.One of the standout features of this fan is its battery life. On a full charge, the fan can last several hours, even at higher speeds. The USB charging feature is particularly convenient, allowing you to charge it via a laptop, power bank, or any standard USB charger. The battery indicator is a thoughtful addition, keeping you informed of the remaining charge.The fan is straightforward to use with an intuitive button control that adjusts the speed. It also includes a small base that can attach to the bottom, allowing it to stand on a flat surface for hands-free operation. This dual functionality enhances its utility, making it more than just a handheld fan.While the fan is generally effective, it might not be suitable for those needing extensive cooling over large areas due to its compact size. Also, while the build is sturdy, the fan's plastic components may not endure rough handling over time.Overall, the Gaiatop Portable Hand Held Fan is a reliable, handy accessory for anyone looking to stay cool on the go. Its combination of effective performance, good battery life, and portable design makes it a worthwhile investment for everyday use and travel. It strikes a good balance between functionality and convenience, making it a recommended choice for personal cooling needs.

If you are looking for a two in one easy to carry around with you and doesn't take up space in a bag/purse this is the product for you. I do not have pictures unfortunately but I was recommended this product from a friend of mine; I loved hers and decided to get my own. I brought this to a concert with me only used the portable part more than the fan bcuz luckily the venue was well air conditioned. Fan is a little lousy but it's easy to tune it out. Charger port did last me a good while for me so I'm thankful for that bcuz not a lot of portable charges have a big enough battery. I love this product and would buy it again if I needed to

Bought this for vacation but didn’t use it as much as I thought I would. It works well, is super quiet and is small & compact so super easy to carry around. I didn’t use it as a portable charger only because I didn’t need it but loved having the option without having to carry something separate! I did test it out to make sure it worked and it charged my phone for the minute I had to plugged in. I don’t know how long the battery life is just because I haven’t used it a ton, maybe 5-6 times but I will say I haven’t had to charge it again and I bought it over a month ago! Super cute color & design too so extra points for that.

Quick charge, compact, good air flow. It was nice to have during an MLB game.HOWEVER! One should be very mindful of the open blades. Especially when consuming a few ballpark beers (they just hit different). Once, while conversing with my fellow attendee, my hand got too close to my head and my hair got caught in the fan. Not a big chunk, but those side pieces you pull down from your ball cap to look cute. There was no way to detangle that mess so I had to rip it from my skull. I was given another ballpark beer, and a hot dog, to dull my pain.THEN...the game was getting close. Cubs looked like they were about to rally. So many cheers. Loud shouting. Booing the Cubs fans in our row. Aggressive hand gestures. You know the drill. Top of the 9th, Reds leading 4-3. Wilson pitches to Ian Happ with 1 out. Happ fouls it straight up towards Reds dugout. Tyler Stephenson runs towards it, throws his mask, and makes A SLIDING CATCH FOR THE OUT! It. Was. Beautiful. We are hollering like the hillbillies we are and I am waving my hands like I just don't care. And that is when I smack myself in the face with open blades while trying to clap.Yes, I am a grown woman who can handle her liquor. Even stadium beers. But I don't think I'll be using this fan again. And the next one I buy will have a cage around the blades.Let's go Reds!!!

I purchases my daughter the pink one a year or so ago and she loves it for hot cruise days, hot beach time, anytime a fan can be used! It's such a bonus to be able to charge her phone if needed too. So I thought, what the heck, let me but one for our next cruise.I tested it out to check how fast it charged my phone and it was meh, nowhere near fast charging, but hey in a punch you take what you can get right. We'll, my husband walks in and says omg what is that noise! He can hear those high pitched noises like a dog can hear a whistle. He found it was the charger. I go closer and can hear it too. I assumed it was defective but hey, we have a year old one so I tried that and same thing after a few minutes.Now, my daughter has an iPhone and I have an android. I know I phones don't charge as fast as androids, so it may be that my phone is trying to pull too much charge and hers isn't. So, she's fine with hers, but I returned it and purchased a different variety that doesn't kill my husband's ears when I charge my phone with it.Would I recommend? If you're an iPhone user, yes, most definitely. Android? No, go with the JisuLife one as it doesn't give the high pitched noise that will drive any babies/pets/sensitive husband's crazy. They have one that's 4500mAh,its bigger but also so much stronger (white fan in the photos)White fan (other brand sucks at balance when closed, no matter how you lie it down when closed it wants to aggressively flip to have usb openings facing upPink fan (this brand) has mini fins that kinda hold it in place so no rolling aroundPink fan wants to walk off the table when using it on Max speed. White fan (again, other brand) has a rubber bit around the light that conveniently holds it in place no matter the speed when on a tabletop

Purchased one for my daughter for our Italy and Greece trip. Loved it so much, I got one too! This is a MUST HAVE item! Not just for travel, but to keep in your purse at all times! lol! It has come in handy so, so many times and people are always commenting they wish they had one and asking where did I get it! I would not have survived our summer without this. I use it everyday..outside, inside. Anytime I’m in line, or just need some cooling off. Lifesaver!  we loved them! Stays charged for a long time and fast! It makes minimal noise, and I love my white one, while my daughter has the pink color. Cleans easily and are good quality. Very very happy with my purchase and would buy from again.

It's really cute.  Although because it's so compact, I could see how it might be a little challenging to open for some people.  If you don't want your small kids messing with it though, they may not be able to figure it out, so that's nice.I love the soft blades, so no chance of fingers being caught or hurt.  I really like the color, although I would have loved it in a deep purple too.Definitely does the job as I am a woman of a particular age 😊 and have hot flashes.  I also appreciate that it does have two speeds.  It's a welcome addition to my life.

I bought this little fan honestly because of the color, 😆 I was pleasantly surprised that while sitting pool side I was able to keep sweat off my face! This will be perfect for cruises! It’s not loud, it’s not heavy, it’s rechargeable, it packs just enough power that it won’t chop off your finger but you can pleasantly enjoy a nice steady breeze! Love that it came with a lanyard clip too! People said it was hard to open.. I had no issues as you can see in the video..

It works great for hot flashes. But you need it with you all the time. I was packing it in my pocket most of the time on our vacation. I didn't want to pack my purse with me everywhere, Its a little bulky for a pocket. (glad I had it) Small and powerful. Wouldn't have survived our vacation with out it.  Charge lasted all day and gose with me just about everywhere now.

Game changer experience! The Gaiatop Portable Hand Held Fan emerges as a versatile and efficient solution for those in need of a compact cooling device. Equipped with a USB rechargeable 2000mAh battery, this fan is designed for both convenience and performance.  One of the things I love is that it fits comfortably in a purse, tote or backpack.One of the standout features of this fan is its battery life. On a full charge, the fan can last several hours, even at higher speeds. The USB charging feature is particularly convenient, allowing you to charge it via a laptop, power bank, or any standard USB charger. The battery indicator is a thoughtful addition, keeping you informed of the remaining charge.The fan is straightforward to use with an intuitive button control that adjusts the speed. It also includes a small base that can attach to the bottom, allowing it to stand on a flat surface for hands-free operation. This dual functionality enhances its utility, making it more than just a handheld fan.While the fan is generally effective, it might not be suitable for those needing extensive cooling over large areas due to its compact size. Also, while the build is sturdy, the fan's plastic components may not endure rough handling over time.Overall, the Gaiatop Portable Hand Held Fan is a reliable, handy accessory for anyone looking to stay cool on the go. Its combination of effective performance, good battery life, and portable design makes it a worthwhile investment for everyday use and travel. It strikes a good balance between functionality and convenience, making it a recommended choice for personal cooling needs.

If you are looking for a two in one easy to carry around with you and doesn't take up space in a bag/purse this is the product for you. I do not have pictures unfortunately but I was recommended this product from a friend of mine; I loved hers and decided to get my own. I brought this to a concert with me only used the portable part more than the fan bcuz luckily the venue was well air conditioned. Fan is a little lousy but it's easy to tune it out. Charger port did last me a good while for me so I'm thankful for that bcuz not a lot of portable charges have a big enough battery. I love this product and would buy it again if I needed to

Bought this for vacation but didn’t use it as much as I thought I would. It works well, is super quiet and is small & compact so super easy to carry around. I didn’t use it as a portable charger only because I didn’t need it but loved having the option without having to carry something separate! I did test it out to make sure it worked and it charged my phone for the minute I had to plugged in. I don’t know how long the battery life is just because I haven’t used it a ton, maybe 5-6 times but I will say I haven’t had to charge it again and I bought it over a month ago! Super cute color & design too so extra points for that.

This unit extends a standard duplex AC plug to 5 standard outlets plus 4 USB charging ports--2 USBA and 2 USBC. It even has an attractive built-in night light that you can enable/disable. Although, the night light only has a light sensor; it does not have a motion sensor, so it is either on when it's dark or it isn't.The only reason I didn't give the unit 5 stars is because it doesn't mount flush against the wall. It sticks out about an 1/8"", which means it wobbles around on the outlet when you plug in an AC cord unless you hold it. I had a unit that did flush mount but the USB ports died after the first power outage, so that was a no-go.The unit was quite easy to install but I wouldn't recommend it for traveling. You don't want to be taking a faceplate off of an outlet in a hotel!

This has been super handy near by bedside as it has a light ring that pops on when you turn the lights off, like a mini night light. It makes it easy to see which cord you're grabbing in the dark as well. It was well worth the price. Been using a few weeks now and it's been awesome. So wish I would have gotten this sooner. The plugs do seem a hit hard to push in, but I'm assuming that's a safety feature and is only a hassle if trying to plug something in at a weird angle. USB ports seem to charge at a good rate of speed too.

Sturdy outer packaging so the item wasn't damaged during shipping (UPS here likes to throw boxes around and they get crushed).Contents include the extender and a piece of paper showing how to disable the night light (very helpful because the night light button is a touch sensor so there is no physical button - I wouldn't have figured this out myself).Only 2 screwdrivers needed: a flathead (to remove the screw from my original outlet) and a Philips (to secure this extender in place). Quick tip: I stored the original outlet screw inside the little hole where the extender screw is and put a small piece of tape over it. My outlet's original screw fits perfectly inside that little cubby hole and I'll have it ready in case I want to remove the extender in the future.I tried screwing in the extender 2 different ways - with the outlet wall plate on and the outlet wall plate off. The extender fit no matter what. I left the wall plate on because the extender will not cover the gap between the extender and wall so dust can get in between.Working great out of the box so far.

I used 4 AC plugs and one USB-C. It does not have a button to turn light on or off. The light will automatically turn on at night. I use the USB-C to charge my phone at night, and I don't see any flickering light. It is just a regular night light. I have a feeling that USB-C charge faster than USB-A.

As an avid outdoors enthusiast and frequent user of lighters, I recently had the opportunity to test out the latest electric lighter that boasts durability, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. After putting it through its paces in various situations, I can confidently say that this is one of the best lighters I've come across in a long time.Durability: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)The first thing that impressed me about this electric lighter was its remarkable durability. It's evident that the manufacturers spared no expense in crafting a sturdy and reliable product. The outer casing is made of high-quality materials, which not only ensures longevity but also makes it resistant to accidental drops and impacts. I accidentally dropped it a few times during my camping trips, and it continued to function flawlessly without any signs of damage. This level of durability gives me peace of mind that it can withstand the rigors of outdoor adventures and everyday use.Efficiency: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)In terms of efficiency, this electric lighter surpasses traditional gas lighters by a considerable margin. It ignites instantly with just a push of a button, eliminating the need for flint or fluid refills. Whether I needed to start a campfire, light up a stove, or illuminate a candle, it consistently delivered a reliable flame without fail. The windproof design is another highlight; it proved effective even during gusty conditions, making it a reliable companion for outdoor activities. With its powerful battery, I've gone weeks without recharging, showcasing its efficient power management system.Cost-Effectiveness: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)One of the most significant advantages of this electric lighter is its cost-effectiveness. Although the initial price may be slightly higher compared to disposable lighters, it quickly proves to be the more economical choice in the long run. The rechargeable battery not only reduces the environmental impact of disposable lighters but also saves money on constant lighter replacements. Additionally, the lack of fuel or butane refills further contributes to its cost-effectiveness, making it an environmentally friendly and budget-friendly option.Pros:Exceptional durability, built to withstand accidental drops and impacts.Instant ignition with a reliable flame, no need for flint or fluid refills.Windproof design ensures consistent performance in adverse weather conditions.Long-lasting battery life with efficient power management.Cost-effective with rechargeable battery and no need for fuel refills.Cons:None worth mentioning.In conclusion, I highly recommend this durable, efficient, and cost-effective electric lighter to anyone in need of a reliable ignition source.

I am a sucker for technology. When I read Plasma Arch Electric Candle Lighter, I was hooked.As soon as the season changes and the sun is down before dinner, we break out the candles and the stick matches. My wife is a gourmet cook, lucky me. My job is to pair the wine, choose the music, set the table, and light the candles. We also throw dinner parties, and setting the table for twelve is not unusual.Now, about the Fukkuda lighter. The first time I used it, I was sold. It works by passing the arch of electricity over the candle's wick, and then, poof, there is flame. It puts on a show if you have never seen anything like this before. My wife, who has no interest in technology, was even impressed. It's an elegant little electronic device that is easy to use with a simple button push. Also, the lighter has become my party trick when we have dinner parties. Everyone is impressed. Fun!In addition, this is simply the best way to light a candle.

i blind bought this because i am constantly lighting candles and am SO FREAKING TIRED of the normal candle lighters running out of fuel and having to click click click to get the tiniest flame going.i saw this had good reviews, was rechargeable, and honestly just seemed cool. when you ""light this"", it's not like your typical lighter. it literally looks like a taser electricity is running between the the two little ""sticks.""my only complaint is that this does NOT come with a charger (WHY?????), and you can ONLY use a charger that is 3A max and not a fast charger at all. luckily i already had one at home. so, just know this before buying that you're going to be annoyed if you don't have a charger block when this arrives.this thing charges super fast, works amazing, and i will absolutely buy another one of these if/when this one fails. fantastic product!will update review if anything changes.

First time using an electronic lighter to start a campfire and have to say it works pretty good. Wind does not effect it compared to a regular butane lighter. Overall I really like this, but there are a few minor issue for me to deduct 1 star.1. The slide switch is loose. When sliding to the on/off position it does not lock into place. Mines will move around and if the switch is not in the on position  the plasma flame will not come on. Have to make sure I push it up before pressing the button.2. The plasma flame is slightly small with only 1 and there is like a 10-15sec limit that it stays on for before powering off. Also the width of the arc is narrow. A few millimeters wider and it would be better to light small branches and wood.For the price this works great. But if I have to do it again I would suggest getting one that has more than 1 plasma arc and a little bigger.Oh yeah this is an electric light so if you use it near metal it will cut out as a safety. I accidentally got to close to the metal grill and short out my lighter. All let's went off and lighter would not work. But after plugging it into a USB charger the lights came back on and all works normally. Good to know that there is a safety protection built in :)

Overall I've really enjoyed this lighter. The battery life has surprised me, its easy to operate, and its got a cool safety switch design. I got it because I was tired of my conventional fireplace and candle lighters running out of fuel.The only downside I've run into is that the gap between the electrodes is a bit more narrow than I'd like. New, slender candle wicks will fit in there just fine. But as some wicks burn, they get a bit chunky with residue, and have a hard time fitting. You'll end up with residue on the electrodes themselves from making contact with the wicks, which you have to wipe off periodically.Not a huge issue or deal breaker at all, especially considering the price! The only other thing I'd call out is you may need to hold the arc on a wick a bit longer than you'd guess for the flame to really take. Again, we're talking seconds. Not a big issue, just something that I had to learn as I used it.Fun product. :)

I will admit, I was hoping I could use this the same as a regular lighter, but it only will really work on candles. Maybe it would work to light lint on fire, but I gave up on trying to light a campfire. Works great for candles.

I'm obsessed with candles, I love them, have them everywhere on our main level. I light them every night.  I can't help it, it's sort of a problem.  Well, I came across this gadget one day and decided to give it a try.  It's awesome.  It keeps a charge for a long time, it charges quickly via USB, it's safe, and it's kind of fun to use.  I'm not a pyro, but if I were, I think this would be the tool I'd use.  I love it.

i blind bought this because i am constantly lighting candles and am SO FREAKING TIRED of the normal candle lighters running out of fuel and having to click click click to get the tiniest flame going.i saw this had good reviews, was rechargeable, and honestly just seemed cool. when you ""light this"", it's not like your typical lighter. it literally looks like a taser electricity is running between the the two little ""sticks.""my only complaint is that this does NOT come with a charger (WHY?????), and you can ONLY use a charger that is 3A max and not a fast charger at all. luckily i already had one at home. so, just know this before buying that you're going to be annoyed if you don't have a charger block when this arrives.this thing charges super fast, works amazing, and i will absolutely buy another one of these if/when this one fails. fantastic product!will update review if anything changes.

First time using an electronic lighter to start a campfire and have to say it works pretty good. Wind does not effect it compared to a regular butane lighter. Overall I really like this, but there are a few minor issue for me to deduct 1 star.1. The slide switch is loose. When sliding to the on/off position it does not lock into place. Mines will move around and if the switch is not in the on position  the plasma flame will not come on. Have to make sure I push it up before pressing the button.2. The plasma flame is slightly small with only 1 and there is like a 10-15sec limit that it stays on for before powering off. Also the width of the arc is narrow. A few millimeters wider and it would be better to light small branches and wood.For the price this works great. But if I have to do it again I would suggest getting one that has more than 1 plasma arc and a little bigger.Oh yeah this is an electric light so if you use it near metal it will cut out as a safety. I accidentally got to close to the metal grill and short out my lighter. All let's went off and lighter would not work. But after plugging it into a USB charger the lights came back on and all works normally. Good to know that there is a safety protection built in :)

Overall I've really enjoyed this lighter. The battery life has surprised me, its easy to operate, and its got a cool safety switch design. I got it because I was tired of my conventional fireplace and candle lighters running out of fuel.The only downside I've run into is that the gap between the electrodes is a bit more narrow than I'd like. New, slender candle wicks will fit in there just fine. But as some wicks burn, they get a bit chunky with residue, and have a hard time fitting. You'll end up with residue on the electrodes themselves from making contact with the wicks, which you have to wipe off periodically.Not a huge issue or deal breaker at all, especially considering the price! The only other thing I'd call out is you may need to hold the arc on a wick a bit longer than you'd guess for the flame to really take. Again, we're talking seconds. Not a big issue, just something that I had to learn as I used it.Fun product. :)

I recently purchased this retractable car charger with 100W power specifically designed for double iPhones, yes, I have two, and I must say, it has exceeded my expectations in terms of functionality and convenience.One of the key features is the fast charging capability. With 100W power output, it charges my iPhones quickly, which is incredibly convenient, especially when I'm on the go and need a quick power boost.The dual charging ports are fantastic, allowing me to charge both my iPhones simultaneously without any decrease in charging speed.What stands out is the retractable cables. They not only eliminate cable clutter but also keep the car interior tidy and organized. The retractable design is a game-changer for me as it prevents tangled cables and makes storing the charger hassle-free.The two additional ports are particularly handy when I'm traveling with a passenger who also needs to charge their device.Furthermore, it plugs snuggly into the cigarette socket ensuring a secure connection, so I never have to worry about the charger coming loose while driving.Overall, I highly recommend this item to anyone looking for a reliable, fast-charging solution for their vehicles. It's sleek, efficient, and delivers on its promises, making it a must-have accessory for any car owner. I bought an additional four for my family as stocking stuffers!

I love this charger! I have a manual shift Jeep, and was constantly battling charger cords laying all around the shift console. This charger block is a petfect solution, as they are the perfect length, and the cords disappear when not in use. The fast charging is also a huge bonus. Great product - highly recommended.

I wanted to get rid of the mess of charging cables that sits up in the front of my car. This device provides a neat and tidy way of storing both a lightning cable and a USB-C cable, as well as providing extra charging ports.It's a solid unit and feels sturdy, should last a long time.Just note that the retractable cables are somewhat short (80cm or about 2.5ft). It's enough for passengers in the front seat, but will not reach the backseat.My only complaint is that the included retractable cables do not fast charge my phone. Using a thicker cable in the extra USB ports will fast charge your phone if needed though, so it's not the end of the world.

At last, I don't have a mess of cables in my car for my charging needs. I absolutely love this product. The retractable cables keep everything nice, neat and clean. And the additional plugs allow me to charge my watch. The fact that it tilts once it's inserted into the outlet is great for improved accessibility. It's so good. I'm buying one for the motorhome and another one for our other vehicle.

The pull-out charge cables are great, I don't have to worry if my cables are in the vehicle anymore. They work as described. The adjustability of angles is great. Having the volt meter on it is not only great just to have and make sure it's connected properly, but it helps to see how your vehicle's charging system is working.  I could see fluctuations from the start of the vehicle's current battery level, to while driving, and I know my alternator is putting out what it's supposed to.

This is great for the car as it swivels in nearly any direction. My only issue is that the connector is a bit hard to get a hold of when you want to pull it from the fully retracted position. I think a small thumb tab sticking out from each of the two connectors would make it easier to use. But overall, great job.

Great mini-doughnut maker!! . Exceeded my expectations. Heats fast! Easy to use! Makes mini donuts so fast, I like to bake each donut for 3 minutes. Looks adorable, comes with recipes, cooks well and super easy to clean!

This was our first time using the mini donut maker since I purchased it several months ago.  My son had been asking for donuts and I kept forgetting.  I love traditional frosted and glazed donuts, not a fan really of cake donuts.  I wanted to try a yeast recipe but I haven't yet.  I used a box of Duncan Hines Moist Yellow Cake mix and prepared it according to the box instructions. I used chocolate frosting for some and made a glaze with powdered sugar, a little vanilla extract, salt and milk for the others.  I dipped about half the glazed donuts in sprinkles.  The don't maker gets very hot pretty quickly. I didn't spray the inside with oil though the instructions recommend you do, they still came out rather easily.  I used a mini spatula. These require a lie of hands on attention. I piped the donuts in the maker using a piping bag.  Let them bake up to 1.5 minutes and then flipped them, I think 1 minute to 1 minute 15 sec was best.  Then let them bake another minute. Then gently slip the mini spatula in there top scoop them out. They didn't stick at all. Then I allowed them to cool a few minutes and topped them to suit kids tastes. It was fun and using the cake mix turned out much better than I expected.  It wasn't too much like a cupcake and wasn't as dense as a cake donut, they actually seemed like bakery donuts almost. I had no trouble cleaning.  After it cooled down I just wiped it off with a damp cloth.  I think the design is pretty cute.  I have a cart that I stock all my novelty kitchen appliances in. It doesn't take up a lot of space but it isn't something I would use regularly.  Just for fun.  These would be fun to bring in for coworkers to enjoy, my kids had fun sharing them with their friends.

I have wanted to get one of these for a while now but just never got around to it. Finally I decided on this one (thanks Amazon review family) and let me tell you. I LOVE IT!First impressions, the color blue/aqua matches all my other retro-y stuff which is the same color. For some that might not be a thing but for me it is hehe.It heats up very quickly and even on a first time heat up there was very little to no ""new device"" smell.The first thing I tried was using both a lemon and a chocolate cake mix. I was looking for a substantial amount of mini donuts and a flavor choice.The instructions suggest flipping at about a minute and a half and then cooking for up to another 3 mins. I noticed the chocolate mix seemed to cook a bit faster. Also, after doing it a couple times you kind of get a sense of when to flip them.It recommends using a toothpick and I can see why! I didn't have any so had to use a skewer and it did make some holes when flipping. So I will invest in toothpicks for future batches.The donught holes don't come out as holes (maybe this is a learning curve idk) but I solved that problem with a simple cone loader (if you know you know) the hole is the PERFECT size to punch out the donut holes lol.Even with only making a few at a time, it's a simple task and before long you have a LOT of donuts. One cake mix box will make idk, maybe like 30 of them? It's hard to say because we were eating them as fast as I could pump them out!They come out not really like donuts, more like little mini cakes and are quite delish. Overall a total win 10/10 recommend

You could say I am a microscopy enthusiast.  I wanted a scope to use when I'm out with my kids.  I wanted something that my 5 year old could use, but powerful enough that we could all enjoy it.  I suspect a lot of buyers might be thinking the same thing, so here's my thoughts on using this with young kids.I purchased the following portable microscopes/magnifiers and tried them all out:* Carson MicroMini 20x LED Lighted Pocket Microscope (MM-280B) ** THIS ITEM *** Carson MicroBrite Plus 60x-120x Power LED Lighted Pocket Microscope (MM-300)* Carson 60X-75X MicroMax LED Lighted Pocket Microscope (MM-200)* Carson 10x LumiLoupe (LL10)I included a picture for size comparison.For our intended use, I expect to get the most use from the MM-280B.  The magnification is good enough to suprise you with what you see, revealing details that are still small enough to be unexpected and exciting.  Yet it is still easy enough to use that my 5 year old can use it with some help.It's super easy to focus and very small, smaller than expected.  It's the smallest of the scopes I tried by a large margin.  The LED is bright enough to use it even in the dark and still get a good image.  Batteries were included.I found that with the other, higher magnification, scopes it was too hard to focus and share with my kids -- even extremely tiny movements in my hand would consistently cause the image to shift or knocked out of focus.  It was too hard to get an image and share it with my kids on those scopes, even at their lowest magnification.  The MM-300 in particular was AMAZING in terms of image, but it isn't great for sharing.  I will keep that one to myself. :-)On this scope, the 20x magnification was good enough to see plenty of detail and still be able to share it with each other without losing focus.  The LL10 was obviously super easy to share since no focusing is required and the field-of-view on that one is HUGE.  Unfortunately, the loupes only go up to 10x and that does not seem to be quite enough magnification to impress the kids (let alone adult myself).  If there was a Carson 20x pre-focused loupe, I'd try that out, but the off-brand options I could find looked pretty low-quality.I wasn't too big on having UV, but as it turned out this is somewhat useful already.  A number of the minerals we have found already are UV reactive.The only drawback is that this thing won't actually survive on my keychain.  It does seem very durable, but I am confident it would eventually be scratched or rendered inoperable if it were to become part of my ""everyday carry"" and endure frequent nicks and bumps.  I need to look into some sort of small case or something.  A lens cap/cover to protect the optics from my keys would make this ideal.The other scopes were great for other purposes but I think that if you are planning to let your kids use this, this one is a good choice.  If you want something that a 5-year old (or younger) can use without any help at all, then the LL10 is a good choice but they probably won't be amazed by the details they discover, it will be more of a ""mildly interesting"" reaction with the LL10.  The others have more impressive magnification, but will be hard for kids to use.  This one was a great middle ground.

I would’ve never imagined, even when I researched it, that this mini micro would be so powerful!This is how I found out how powerful it is. I randomly found a tiny bump on the back of my head. I tried to remove it from my hair, by picking it up with my nails. But, it felt like a tiny stone imbedded in my scalp.Upon removing it, I realized it wasn’t in my nails. Then, I couldn’t find the spot I had pulled it from. Because I thought it would look as big as it felt, I combed my hair believing it would drop in the (white) sink.I shed a lot of hair & my hair is very long. Upon picking up the tangled hair from the sink, I noticed two black specks on one of the hairs. Those specks were about the size of an 1/8th of a pinhead, or even smaller!I got curious, and not only wanted to see in the micro mini what that black specks were, but TEST the mini for the first time! (I was NOT thinking at all about the embedded thing I had just removed.)Upon placing the specks on a piece of white paper, I secured them with a piece of clear tape. Then proceeded to look at them under the mini microscope.OMG it looks like a SPIDER split in two!!! But, to me, it has too many legs. All spiders have 8legs & I counted 12. To me, it’s mind blowing HOW BIG THEY LOOK!!! (Assuming it’s two spiders & not one.) Now, I wonder & will research how much smaller could some baby spiders be?Later on, I remembered that the previous day I had sat at my favorite spot; on a bench under a tree.I highly recommend this Micro Mini! It is much, much more than what I expected it to be.

This little 20-power magnifier isn't like the other, more powerful Carson mini-microscopes. The other ones, which are more powerful, use a very tiny objective lens together with a bright LED to provide the light needed to make up for the small objective lens. In those other pocket microscopes, the small objective lens makes focusing vastly easier. This little 20x keychain magnifier uses a more conventional lens arrangement, most likely two, one the objective and the other the eyepiece. The objective lens is probably about 13 mm in diameter, which together with the 20x power means that in daylight you could do without the LED. But with the LED, you get a nice bright image regardless. The focusing isn't terribly difficult, owing to the magnification not being especially strong. All in all it is a good solution for a 20 x magnifier that you can easily carry on a keychain, if you want. The most noteworthy drawback is that the sliding switch on the side is very cheap and difficult to use. It doesn't want to move, and when it does, it wants to go all the way from one end to the other. The 'off' position is in the center; the two end positions are for the LED you use when using the magnifier, and the auxiliary LED that serves as a flashlight and gives you a reason to carry it on your keychain. It also has a little UV light, which I suppose is for when you look at rocks that glow under UV light. Or maybe for getting a close-up look at scorpions. To make the switch behave, you have to press down on it firmly and move it in a controlled manner. I'm just not sure how long it is going to last when used this way. But it doesn't cost much so if it eventually stops working it isn't a big deal, and even without the light it is a useful magnifying lens. Recommended with only the weakest of reservation.

This little 20-power magnifier isn't like the other, more powerful Carson mini-microscopes. The other ones, which are more powerful, use a very tiny objective lens together with a bright LED to provide the light needed to make up for the small objective lens. In those other pocket microscopes, the small objective lens makes focusing vastly easier. This little 20x keychain magnifier uses a more conventional lens arrangement, most likely two, one the objective and the other the eyepiece. The objective lens is probably about 13 mm in diameter, which together with the 20x power means that in daylight you could do without the LED. But with the LED, you get a nice bright image regardless. The focusing isn't terribly difficult, owing to the magnification not being especially strong. All in all it is a good solution for a 20 x magnifier that you can easily carry on a keychain, if you want. The most noteworthy drawback is that the sliding switch on the side is very cheap and difficult to use. It doesn't want to move, and when it does, it wants to go all the way from one end to the other. The 'off' position is in the center; the two end positions are for the LED you use when using the magnifier, and the auxiliary LED that serves as a flashlight and gives you a reason to carry it on your keychain. It also has a little UV light, which I suppose is for when you look at rocks that glow under UV light. Or maybe for getting a close-up look at scorpions. To make the switch behave, you have to press down on it firmly and move it in a controlled manner. I'm just not sure how long it is going to last when used this way. But it doesn't cost much so if it eventually stops working it isn't a big deal, and even without the light it is a useful magnifying lens. Recommended with only the weakest of reservation.

The optics are flipped. It's a difficult to focus, mirror imaged version of whatever you're trying to look at. Useless.

I bought 3 of the Carson MicroMini 20x LED Lighted Pocket Microscope with Built-in UV and LED Flashlights and gifted them to my grandchildren that were visiting and the next thing I knew they were looking at the printed dots of ink that make up pictures and words. Next, it was the bugs and other captive creatures. They even found dirt on the floor!These were a nice size, well built and having battery powered lights helped to make this item useful and entertaining.

So I bought this in a bundle and the larger scope is okay but this is much simpler and easier to use when checking for clarity or Amber.

I needed somewhere to put my water bottles. I have limited space and I needed them off my counters. These are ready to use right out of the package. I believe they can hold some weight. I put about 100 AA batteries in one of the smaller shelves, the magnet didn’t even budge! 2 are bigger in size than the other 2. I have 30oz water bottles in the bigger size. I think they look great. They seem pretty sturdy. I definitely recommend them! I bought them in prime day so I got a really good deal. But they are worth the money I spent!

These racks are fantastic! The magnetic backing on these hold super well to anything metal, and they don't budge at all. I haven't organized my spices yet, but I have much heavier items in them right now and it's pretty awesome how well it holds everything solidly. They even come with little plastic hooks with which one can hang pot holders or small dog. I also have spray bottles hanging off the edges, and your cat can even use them for steps to climb to the top of your refrigerator. Speaking of which, have you dusted the top of your refrigerator lately? It gets NASTY up there! Just saying.

Just received these today and absolutely love them! They are exactly what I needed. I have too little kitchen and too large spice inventory. With a texture sided refrigerator I was getting discouraged with my search for something that would work. The shelves are very good quality, ready to put up and extremely sturdy! The magnets stick well and don’t move when items are placed on the shelves. Very good storage space for my large inventory of spices. Great value for the money…one of my best purchases and will be ordering a few more!

Needed some storage for my spices since I didn’t want to store them on my small counter. Stumble upon these magnetic storage and decided to try them out. I was surprise how strong the magnets are!

OVERALL - Great! Very sturdy and well-made. One of the side rails isn't fully attached to the backing and is a little loose, probably will fix with gel glue and doesn't really affect the shelf structurally. Nice white coating. Aesthetically pleasing. Strong and holds small-medium items solidly. Haven't tried heavier items as the shelving isn't very deep. Small hooks are a nice bonus. BE AWARE - there are six shelves: 3 are a larger size and 3 are slightly smaller. Look at the measurement photo carefully. All six are not the same size. The first image in the Amazon series shows the shelves as spanning the width of the fridge. They are deceptively short. My fridge is the typical white drink fridge that your parents had in the garage or basement for overflow Sunny-D, Capri Sun, and beer. It's not overly wide and yet two shelves can still go side by side. These have slats so they're easy to clean but smaller items may slip through. A good buy and wroth the price. 👍

I use these on the side of my fridge for my spices so I can use that space in my cupboard. Great for small spaces when space is at a premium. They're strong and sturdy and the magnets are also strong so they don't move. You can arrange them any way you'd like which is also helpful instead of being 1 long piece there are 4. Would definitely recommend

There isn't too much more to say about these magnetic shelves aside from that they are AWESOME! Especially if you need just a little more shelf space in your kitchen.  They are incredibly strong magnets; these babies aren't coming down any time soon.  I use them to hold some of my large sized spice bottles as I buy frequently used spices in bulk.  I only have 1/2 side of a side of my refrigerator where I can use them, but I've been able to clear out some space in my cabinet by using these shelves.  I could put one on the front of the fridge, but I think that would look a bit tacky.  If you are worried about whether they are strong enough to hold the things you have in mind for it...  don't be they will hold a significant amount of weight for their size due to the strength of their magnetic field.  Highly Recommend

Best impulse purchase ever!!! Small kitchen with literally overflowing cabinets that rain spices and tea on our heads every time we open them. I was so sick of it, so when I saw these on prime day I figured what do I have to lose? Omg...they are so well made, hold so much and don't budge under the weight. I put a full large bottle of soy sauce in one and it didn't move at all!!! My one cabinet is completely decluttered and the shelves look so darn cute too! I just came on to order a second set because I have a large fridge and can fit so much more from other cabinets. These would also be awesome for organizing medicine bottles. I was able to spread out and organize my spices, sprinkles for baking, and a bunch of other stuff. I can't say enough good things about them. Order them...you won't regret it!

Volume control is really simple and they’re very easy to use in general.

I've owned four of these, and I genuinely love it. It's a great sleep mask. Good comfort, long multi-night battery life and decent sound. It even charges via USB-C, which I love. As others noted, you must position the speakers carefully for good sound, but that's easy enough. All in all, it's a solid sleep mask at a great price.However, there's one weakness, and that's why I bought four of them. The USB cable on the mask is INCREDIBLY thin. Over time, it just breaks and stops charging. Of the four I've bought, three have died that exact way.That said, I like it enough, and it's cheap enough. I've always just gotten another. It's a good mask, I just wish the charging cable could be a little more durable.

The Musicozy is almost everything I expected...almost.  It suffers from some minor flaws here and there that could be perfected.  The best parts of the mask are the main purpose, it blocks out light WELL, is very comfortable, connects more easily than I expected to bluetooth devices, charges quite fast and connects to and disconnects from charger cable very easily.  Also has pretty good volume and sound transmission (overall...see below).Except for the little electronic control box in the forehead portion and the small audio speakers and adjoining wires, the entire thing is made of superbly-soft material, very comfortable!!  The speakers are perfect because they are pretty much thin discs that transmit sound AROUND the ears rather than penetrating ear buds that would present a threat to hearing over prolonged sleep hours.  The box and the speakers sit loosely in their own built-in 'sleeves' in the well-designed cloth.  The velcro strap on the back of the head is sufficient for a wide range of head sizes.A bit of a problem arises because the speakers sit a bit loose inside their respective sleeves, causing them to sometimes fall a bit too far from the ear canals for good sound transmission while sleeping...and so one tends to tighten and adjust the whole mask portion to get the speakers to land just right.  But in doing so, another little problem becomes evident in that the curve built in to slot around the nose, doesn't curve in enough, and so the bottom edge of the mask will tend to cover the nostrils when trying to get the speakers to cover the ears.  It's a bit annoying but not unmanageable.The tiny light indicators that emanate from the plastic control box inside the mask have to shine through very tiny holes cut into the mask, sometimes these don't line up well because the box sits loosely inside its own little sleeve like the speakers do...so these lights are very hard to see, making it hard to know if its connected and charging, to make sure you have correctly plugged it in to charge or not.I bluetooth into the mask via my ipad at bedtime.  However, after getting up in the morning, when I sit at my desk, I notice my ipad refuses to play sound because it has not disconnected from the mask on its own, obviously since it doesn't know that I have gotten up.  But pressing the power button on the mask does not 'shut off' the mask or cause the ipad to disconnect from the mask.  So I have to manually ""Disconnect"" from Musicozy in order for my ipad to play sound.  It seems the power button on the mask really only serves to pair the mask to a device.Again, minor issues IMO, little bits I have gotten past enough to say that I am very happy with how this product delivers what it claims to deliver.  I helps me sleep much more soundly than I did without it.

I have very mixed feelings about this sleep mask. Pros: long battery life, fairly comfortable, pretty good black out coverage, good sound. Cons: ridiculous flashing light when on but sound is not playing. Sleep timer will say it's set but mask never turns off. Also sometimes does hurt my ears when side sleeping. I often like to fall asleep to a 60 minute podcast and the shortest sleep timer is 90 minutes. Once the podcast ends a very bright flashing light starts which obviously I can't see with the mask on but is very disturbing to my husband and dog sleeping in my bed. I also will wake up after the 90 minutes and the mask is still on and flashing away. I feel like the sleep timer worked for a while but now it just doesn't and I have to manually turn it off. I think I'll have to cover the flashing light with some electrical tape or something but the only annoying thing about doing that is that it is not obvious if it didn't shut off like it should have and may stay on and drain the battery. Overall the sleep mask is still better than another one I've tried but it definitely has its flaws. I do like that it doesn't have an audible battery dead alert that wakes you up like some masks and just turns off quietly without disrupting your sleep. I haven't really used it much for it's built in sounds but it's a nice feature to have.

This is technically 2 products in one.  An eye cover and headphones.  I plan on reviewing both pieces.  The eye cover is wide, so my eyes are completely covered.  The eye cover is comfortable, and has an additional cushion at the bottom rim that does not allow light in if the mask moves around.  There is an adjustable strap along the back, that can go pretty wide, and is made of a comfortable material that doesn't snag or get caught in your hair.  As for the speakers, the ear flaps are long and do cover the ears well, but they are hard.  The speakers have a rubber coating on them, but they are still too large to be comfortable while you sleep on your side.  Also, the speakers have to app that can be downloaded and used to control the music and a turn off point.  I don't want to have it run all night.  All in all.  They are only ok.  Not really worth it, and I have returned them for a full refund.

My sleeping the past several months has slowly gotten worse and worse. I finally broke down and asked my doctor for advice. She wanted me to try non-pharmaceutical methods before prescribing something to help me sleep. I agreed because the last time I took medication for sleeping, the daytime hangover was worse than fatigue from just not sleeping. She recommended trying a couple of apps that help put your mind in a meditative state to fall asleep to not just fall asleep but to help you stay asleep. By then, I was willing to try anything to get decent shut eye.First night of trying the app, it helped. I fell asleep easily and stayed asleep more over the night, according to my fitness monitor. The only issue was my earbuds making my ears hurt. I'm a side sleeper and it killed my ears to attempt to sleep with my ear pressed to my pillow. I told the hubby I was going to find more comfortable sleeping earphones. He told me to not go crazy, but to feel free to buy what I felt I needed. I had one pair of sleep mask headphones in my cart before I started reading reviews that stated the controls were on the side of the head and as a side sleeper, they didn't work for the reviewer. I heeded the advice and found these. I am sooooooo glad I did!!They arrived on a Wednesday. Per instructions, I immediately put them on the charger. That night I used them to listen to my app. First, I had to adjust the speakers so I could hear. Minor detail. They worked wonderfully!! I Turn them on, listen to my meditation, wake up the next morning and turn them off.I just wanted the headphones, but the sleep mask helps as well. The light from my coffee pot turning on at 4:45 am every morning no longer wakes me up. Since the strap is adjustable, I can make it to the mask barely touches my face. I don't sweat while wearing them. The only night I have so far, I tightened the mask too much. Once I loosened it, cooled right off. I've tried sleeping with masks on in the past, but they put too much pressure on my eyes. These don't!Now, a note on the battery. I know it says 8+ hours of use. I'm not sure what they mean by that. 8+ hours of music or whatever actually playing? 8+ hours of connection to a device? I'm not sure, but I charged it for the full time as directed in the instructions. The was Wednesday, the day I received them. I did not have to charge them (because they turned off on their own) until the following week's Friday. Granted, the first couple of nights I turned them off once I woke up and the story was done, but for a week, I left them on and connected to my phone all night. For me, that translates into charging about once a week. I've had wireless headphones I used for my walks that I had to charge every third day of use. In my opinion, the battery life has amazed and impressed me! I hope it'll continue to stay that way as I use them.Okay, I might be done rambling now. To sum up, these headphones/sleep mask have been a wonderful addition to my attempt to remain off medications so I get natural sleep. I absolutely would recommend these to anyone who wants to listen to relaxing music all night or bedtime meditations or whatever you want to listen to without disturbing anyone who shares a bed with you. Great price for a great product!!

Overall, I love this sleep mask. It blocks out light well and is perfect for listening to my sleep meditation or binaural beats without disturbing my husband. I also have the headband design this brand also carries and I prefer these for the way they fit. The mask is more padded around the speakers so this design is much more comfortable for me to sleep in. I gave the headband to my husband and he does still enjoy that.A few notes...1-The speakers provide decent volume but need to be fairly well positioned to be heard. The mask tends to slide up a little bit on me as I move at night and once the speakers slide above my ears slightly I can no longer hear it. It's not a huge deal to me as I am usually asleep at this point and will simply adjust if I wake up2- The battery life is good and can usually make it a couple nights for me. It also charges pretty quickly so I can throw it on the charger 20 minutes before bed if I realized I had forgotten to charge it and that will pretty well make it through the night. However, when the battery does get low there is this obnoxious voice that cuts in every 30 seconds or so saying ""Battery Low"". That voice will wake me up if the speakers are still on my ears and has provided quite the jump scare just as I was dozing. Considering these are made for sleeping, I would be ok with the sound just fading out or a soft beep. Safe to say after having that experience a couple of times, I will make sure these are charged before bed. I do wish there was a way that the headset would tell you your battery percentage, but my phone does typically show it on the bluetooth connection.

This is surprisingly comfortable enough to sleep with. The speakers lay flat on your ears.Easy to set up. I used it less than 10x (only on trips away from home) and one night it just stopped working. I was playing white noise and two hours into the night, it just completely died on me and I was left listening to my partner snore.I came home to charge it and it never charged backed up.I guess it’s done.I’m weary to purchase again incase it craps out again but it was useful while it worked.Also wish there was a way to see the battery life on it. The light only ever shows blue when on. I wish it turned yellow when it was wearing and red when needing to be charged or something like that!

This is my second type of headband earphones and these did take a little bit to get used to. I am a side sleeper that sleeps on soft pillows in a hot/ humid climate.Pros: battery life is excellent (make sure to follow the directions exactly when charging) battery will last 12-14 hours if charged correctly.Adjustable headband is amazing, it’s Velcro and can be trimmed.Sound quality is decent for the price. I’m a light sleeper and it drowns out pretty much all background noise.I love the eye mask part more than I thought I would/ it blocks out all the lightCons: fabric is a thick velvet type material and does get hot around the faceEarphones can be uncomfortable and leave your ears feeling sore. If this happens just loosen the Velcro. My ears were sore for about a week but I haven’t had any issues after.

The speakers have a rubber coating on them, but they are still too large to be comfortable while you sleep on your side.  Also, the speakers have to app that can be downloaded and used to control the music and a turn off point.  I don't want to have it run all night.  All in all.  They are only ok.  Not really worth it, and I have returned them for a full refund.

My favorite feature on the mask is the cooling eye gel about the eyes. It feels so good around my eyes without putting pressure on my lid.It blacks out all light.Sound is great.Color is perfectI am definitely going to consider this for gifts for family and friends.

My sleeping the past several months has slowly gotten worse and worse. I finally broke down and asked my doctor for advice. She wanted me to try non-pharmaceutical methods before prescribing something to help me sleep. I agreed because the last time I took medication for sleeping, the daytime hangover was worse than fatigue from just not sleeping. She recommended trying a couple of apps that help put your mind in a meditative state to fall asleep to not just fall asleep but to help you stay asleep. By then, I was willing to try anything to get decent shut eye.First night of trying the app, it helped. I fell asleep easily and stayed asleep more over the night, according to my fitness monitor. The only issue was my earbuds making my ears hurt. I'm a side sleeper and it killed my ears to attempt to sleep with my ear pressed to my pillow. I told the hubby I was going to find more comfortable sleeping earphones. He told me to not go crazy, but to feel free to buy what I felt I needed. I had one pair of sleep mask headphones in my cart before I started reading reviews that stated the controls were on the side of the head and as a side sleeper, they didn't work for the reviewer. I heeded the advice and found these. I am sooooooo glad I did!!They arrived on a Wednesday. Per instructions, I immediately put them on the charger. That night I used them to listen to my app. First, I had to adjust the speakers so I could hear. Minor detail. They worked wonderfully!! I Turn them on, listen to my meditation, wake up the next morning and turn them off.I just wanted the headphones, but the sleep mask helps as well. The light from my coffee pot turning on at 4:45 am every morning no longer wakes me up. Since the strap is adjustable, I can make it to the mask barely touches my face. I don't sweat while wearing them. The only night I have so far, I tightened the mask too much. Once I loosened it, cooled right off. I've tried sleeping with masks on in the past, but they put too much pressure on my eyes. These don't!Now, a note on the battery. I know it says 8+ hours of use. I'm not sure what they mean by that. 8+ hours of music or whatever actually playing? 8+ hours of connection to a device? I'm not sure, but I charged it for the full time as directed in the instructions. The was Wednesday, the day I received them. I did not have to charge them (because they turned off on their own) until the following week's Friday. Granted, the first couple of nights I turned them off once I woke up and the story was done, but for a week, I left them on and connected to my phone all night. For me, that translates into charging about once a week. I've had wireless headphones I used for my walks that I had to charge every third day of use. In my opinion, the battery life has amazed and impressed me! I hope it'll continue to stay that way as I use them.Okay, I might be done rambling now. To sum up, these headphones/sleep mask have been a wonderful addition to my attempt to remain off medications so I get natural sleep. I absolutely would recommend these to anyone who wants to listen to relaxing music all night or bedtime meditations or whatever you want to listen to without disturbing anyone who shares a bed with you. Great price for a great product!!

Overall, I love this sleep mask. It blocks out light well and is perfect for listening to my sleep meditation or binaural beats without disturbing my husband. I also have the headband design this brand also carries and I prefer these for the way they fit. The mask is more padded around the speakers so this design is much more comfortable for me to sleep in. I gave the headband to my husband and he does still enjoy that.A few notes...1-The speakers provide decent volume but need to be fairly well positioned to be heard. The mask tends to slide up a little bit on me as I move at night and once the speakers slide above my ears slightly I can no longer hear it. It's not a huge deal to me as I am usually asleep at this point and will simply adjust if I wake up2- The battery life is good and can usually make it a couple nights for me. It also charges pretty quickly so I can throw it on the charger 20 minutes before bed if I realized I had forgotten to charge it and that will pretty well make it through the night. However, when the battery does get low there is this obnoxious voice that cuts in every 30 seconds or so saying ""Battery Low"". That voice will wake me up if the speakers are still on my ears and has provided quite the jump scare just as I was dozing. Considering these are made for sleeping, I would be ok with the sound just fading out or a soft beep. Safe to say after having that experience a couple of times, I will make sure these are charged before bed. I do wish there was a way that the headset would tell you your battery percentage, but my phone does typically show it on the bluetooth connection.

This is surprisingly comfortable enough to sleep with. The speakers lay flat on your ears.Easy to set up. I used it less than 10x (only on trips away from home) and one night it just stopped working. I was playing white noise and two hours into the night, it just completely died on me and I was left listening to my partner snore.I came home to charge it and it never charged backed up.I guess it’s done.I’m weary to purchase again incase it craps out again but it was useful while it worked.Also wish there was a way to see the battery life on it. The light only ever shows blue when on. I wish it turned yellow when it was wearing and red when needing to be charged or something like that!

This is my second type of headband earphones and these did take a little bit to get used to. I am a side sleeper that sleeps on soft pillows in a hot/ humid climate.Pros: battery life is excellent (make sure to follow the directions exactly when charging) battery will last 12-14 hours if charged correctly.Adjustable headband is amazing, it’s Velcro and can be trimmed.Sound quality is decent for the price. I’m a light sleeper and it drowns out pretty much all background noise.I love the eye mask part more than I thought I would/ it blocks out all the lightCons: fabric is a thick velvet type material and does get hot around the faceEarphones can be uncomfortable and leave your ears feeling sore. If this happens just loosen the Velcro. My ears were sore for about a week but I haven’t had any issues after.

It’s so easy to use! And it froths all manner of things. I bought a black one and used it constantly. What a treat to pamper myself (it’s the little things). But I was running out of the house one day and knocked it into (fully immersed) a pan of water! I didn’t realize it until I came home and no amount of tinkering could save it. On a fluke I reached out to the Zulay Kitchen company, and they sent me a brand new one! What service. They were helpful, kind and humorous during the process. Just a few days later and here it is, ready to use again.Silat Kitchen- Great service!!

I use it to mix a powdered medicine in juice and it does the trick.  Also use it to make chocolate milk.  It's small but mighty.  To get it to mix well bring the end almost to the top of your liquid; you'll see a downward funnel and the powder get mixed in.  If you leave it there near the top it will make a nice froth in your chocolate milk.  I don't do that with the medicine though.

I loved this fan! I was able to walk around the campgrounds in the extreme Texas heat and not feel like I was going to get sick or pass out.

I only had to charge the battery twice in the 5 days we were at camp. I had bought another fan last year that turned out to be a piece of junk. This fan is well made and every easy to use.

It works well and all 3 speeds really help on a hot day. It’s not too loud but I find speed 2 and 3 to be a little too loud when in a group trying to listen. The blowers are not adjustable as it says. Sure you can open it up to get it on but it springs right back into its original position. The air blows directly up so it blows into my ears. Also the vents on the neck do not blow at the same speed at those in the front. I wear it all the time. It is very comfortable and I will run it for 10-15 minutes at a time then shut it off until I need it again. I do find it helpful just wish I could direct the blowers. I would buy it again it is a good value for the money and helps when I’m hot.

The power of the fan is nice but the air doesn't reach the back of the neck, same thing with med. setting and the highest setting! I thought maybe there are too many large holes at the front... I tried covering those up to see if it would help push the air further to the back of the neck.. nope.

This fan is a GODSEND. It really really helps! I am 9 months pregnant and this fan goes with me everywhere. Whenever I start to feel faint or not, I put it on full blast and I immediately feel better. It can power through the toughest of heat waves. The only thing is, it’s not as effective outside. But that may also just be the pregnancy and needing relief as quickly as possible. But, genuinely, this fan is amazing!

This neck fan does the basics reasonably well – it bends, it blows, it’s quiet, it lasts, and most of all, it cooled me.  But I noted several points that would benefit from improvement.  If you’re looking for just the basics at an affordable price, then you’ll probably be happy with this one.  If you’re looking for a well-designed product, this one is not there yet.  Maybe the seller will pass these suggestions back to the manufacturer.This neck fan is ill suited to larger necks.  My neck measure 17 ½ (shirt size) and while this fan does fit around my neck, it will not stay in a U shape as my neck presses it outwards.  I would guess that it would fit someone with a neck size of 15 or below (1 inch less diameter) very well, resting comfortably where it not easily fall off.  On me, I found myself worrying that it would fall off if I did anything more energetic than walking.  In fact, it did fall off a couple times at Disneyland, but they always do remind you to hold onto those hats and glasses!  Having said all that, it still blows the air effectively in just about any position it was in.  I liked how the bendy part between the two fans on each side allowed me twist the fans as well as make them narrower/wider – Twisting is a bit plus in getting the air to just the right spots.The seller touts that it is quiet at 40db.  It sounds to like that might be a realistic claim on the low speed as it is fairly quiet.  However, after a couple hours of use, I noticed that I could not hear people as well as I thought I should.  Turning off the fan made a dramatic improvement in my ability to hear.  For my needs, the low setting was enough 95% of the time.  Occasionally, like when chasing after kids on Pirates Island, I would have a lot of heat built up and then, for maybe 10 minutes, I would use a higher fan speed.  Which is a long winded way of saying that one or two slower speeds would be appreciated.The seller claims 4-16 hours run time.  I did not get near that.  On slow speed, I would only get about 8-9 hours.  Part of this may be a finicky charging design.  This will not work with a high power, true USB C, charger.  It works just fine with style that has a USB C on one end of the cable and USB A on the other.  Luckily, I had an older one around to use for this.  I also observed an oddity when charging it overnight.  (BTW, the charge light only lights us when charging – no light = done charging).  The light would be out in the morning, but if I unplugged the charger for 1 minute and then reconnected it, it would take more of a charge.  It seems that they cut corners in fully impending USB C and in their charging logic.The power button is located on the bottom and 4 presses will cycle you thru low, medium, high, off.  The button reacts well and it is simple to operate.  With it being on the bottom however, I found my collar bone bumping the button and increasing the fan speed.  Not often enough to be a real problem, but a future design should absolutely move the button someplace that won’t get bumped so easily.My use case is, as a larger guy, I tend to sweat sooner and more than the average person.  Many times, I’ve wished for a breeze to evaporate the moisture from my skin.  This neck fan grants that wish on demand.  My test was 5 days at Disneyland in the Southern California heat.  This neck fan greatly improved my comfort level throughout the day – from Park Open until late afternoon when the battery died.  If I had any doubt of its usefulness, the next hour reminded me how much I liked having this neck fan.In summary, this neck fan is useful for cooling, gets reasonably close to it’s stated stats, and is priced attractively at $24.  It would benefit from several design changes.  If you prefer well designed products, then search for one priced a bit higher.  I plan to do that myself and keep this one in reserve or to loan out to friends.

It's a good little camera. Very good quality with closeup pictures, and the end of it is small enough to get into tight spaces (Though because of its length it can't turn corners very well)The software is pretty easy to use. The only confusing this is that the camera is actually a WiFi camera. It only uses the USB port on your phone for power. You can connect it to a power bank and it'll work just fine as well.The connection to my Pixel 7 Pro was stable and a good frame rate.  I've attached photos from the camera to the review here, as well as a video.The dimensions of the camera module itself are 8mm / 0.32 inches in diameter and 68.3mm / 7.7 inches long.  The flexible neck is stiff enough to push the camera through tough spots, and stays bent in whatever shape you make it into.This camera would be great for inspecting engines, gun barrels 9mm / .357 or larger, plumbing, or just about anything else it can fit into.

This gadget is an excellent tool to have in any persons bag of tools. It is incredibly easy to use with a very straight forward app design, along with multiple adapters to use for a variation of phone types. The light on the end is bright enough to lighten the darkest of spaces paired with flexibility to contort into the tightest of angles. I work in awkward spaces and hard to see places on the daily and this simple device makes my job that much easier. Work smarter not harder use this product.

I got this so I could find and route wires that haven't been routed appropriately on charter buses but I'm having so much fun playing with this thing at home. I love it!I was a bit worried it didn't work with my phone though as the instructions say to open my non-existent WLAN settings BUT I found that after plugging it into my phone, I could access it as if it were a WiFi connection, connect to it, using the ANESOK-XXXX name given in the instructions manual, then restart the Anesok app. If the app is already running before plugging it in, it will show connected as wifi but won't connect in the app, make sure the app is completely closed (make sure it's not running in the background) before plugging it in, then it should work fine.

As a person who works in a job field that requires to look around components that are tightly packed, this  endoscope has been a life and time saver. Its compact storage and  quick connection to my phone are only a fraction of its great features. It is made with durable materials and the multiple attachment tips have come in handy. Let me not forget to mention the scopes on board light which provides better clarity in those not so bright spaces. Highly recommend for any DIY, or handy person.

I've only had the charger for about 2 weeks after buying on a lightning deal.  As others have mentioned, it doesn't come with a charging block & it is noted to be 15W, not 20W, I was prepared for both.  That said, I anticipated it being a bit slower charging for my Galaxy S23 Ultra than the fast charge Samsung stand up model it was replacing that took a crash after 7 years.  So far, it has been working well, it does take about 2 hours for my phone to go from almost on life support to 100%, but I like that it is propped up, the green light indicator is on the side to not disturb me, and I can still easily use the phone while charging, if desired, with the lip holding tit in place either upright or sideways.  The entire unit stays cool while in use. So far, so good.  We'll see how it goes.  I have a back up ""rapid charging"" cable & block when this just won't cut it, but I prefer wireless at the end of the day and for most frequent needs.

I ordered two of these for my wife and I's S24's. The setup is literally plugging the cord it comes into, into the charger, and then plugging that cord into a wall adapter you provide. Quick and easy.They work really well. It isn't as fast as a good wall charger; my Samsung charger can take my S24 from close dead to 100% in around an hour; this charger takes about three hours. Either way, great for bed time, you just drop it on the charger and move on.The lights are completely unobtrusive, and I need a dark, dark space to sleep.The only downside I've found to it is that some thicker cases won't allow charging through them, but the slim cases work fine.

My iPhone 11’s charging port is starting to get finicky, so I was hoping this would work and it’s perfect. Good for the price and doesn’t feel cheap, charges quickly and efficiently, looks good on my night stand and is nice and small. I’ll be ordering a couple more for other areas of my house.

Phone sits in stand and charges without any problems. Two things you need to know:  this comes with a cord (c-cord I think) that's about 18 inches long. Not very long. And it doesn't come with a charger, but since you probably already have a plug in charger this would not be a problem. I needed a multiplug to reach an outlet in the bedroom. So far the system is working fine.

Works great! Fast charges my s22 ultra  and S24+ just fine. Just make sure the plug and cable you are using can do fast charging.  If you use a USB type a it won't fast charge.  Which you wold think people would know by now but nope... lol works great!

I had one close to this from my youngest son who gave it to me since I used it everyday while visiting at his home with his new wife to be. I just loved using it and he gifted to me.  Unfortunately, it fell from the shelf where it sat one day and no longer worked and I was heartbroken though I never told him. I decided I needed to finally replace it.  I ordered a different one but it didn't work for me so this was a replacement and works fabulous. I truly love love love it. Sits on my counter and cannot fall again. Yippee. Charges great!!!

I bought this for my desk at work. It works really well and I'm happy with it. It is easy to sit my phone on, and I can even press things on the phone to an extent, without it moving. It's only an occasional issue where it slides back and it's when it's accumulated dirt/dust on the rubber feet. I swipe my finger across it and it stops sliding for a while.The only negative is the length of the cord. It's only a couple of feet. Not long enough to reach the tower under my desk. I guess if you have a monitor with a USB port, you can do that. I just ordered a 6', quality USB-A/USB-C cable and replaced it. No other issues. Charges my iPhone 8 Plus fast.

Bought this to leave on my desk at work because of its small footprint. It looks nice well made for the price but will not charge my samsung galaxy S22 ultra with the otterbox case intermittently. You will set the phone down and randomly sometime a few seconds or sometimes a few minutes it will stop charging and the led will flash indicating an obstruction telling the charger to stop charging. Removing and reinstalling the phone maybe 1 or 2 times will correct the issue and the phone will begin to charge but slowly, at the speed of about 20% to 80% in about 3.5 hrs.

My husband always seems to have problems with phone ports. He would have to fight with his phone cord to get it just right to charge his phone, and then heaven forbid you bump it! He is loving how easy it is to set his phone on this device without all the struggles he previously endured. As some reviewers have mentioned, it is not going to break speed records for charging your phone, but what it lacks in speed, it more than makes up for in ease of use. We are very pleased with this purchase.

I bought this to 'ring' my kids rooms and get their attention. Picture this: each fob is attached to a carabineer and placed in a bedroom closet or basement. Parents need something from one of them, press the corresponding button and the kid knows they are needed. It's amazing. Not too loud, works in upstairs bedrooms and basement. Remote stays in the kitchen. I chose this instead of a doorbell or intercom or yelling or banging on walls. It works perfectly! A room pager, a kid finder. So easy to use and install batteries.

Just received the 'Reyke Key Finder, 80dB+ RF Item Locator Tags'.  I will be using these to help my dog find  her ball, which to her is life itself.  I tried a GPS tag, but, it was too low in volume and finally the app failed well trying to find the lost tag!!  I don't know how well it will stand up to the rigger of ball strikes and dog spit.  To hedge my bet, I have enclosed it in Heat Shrink tubing and suspended with-in the ball with ty-raps.  The ball by the way is a open ball called 'Air Fetch Ball' by Chuckit. I have been using the finder already and I needed it twice.  Since it comes with four tags, I will have spares for when I have to 'send in another Timmy'.  The Range and loudness seems adequate for my needs.  So far I am happy with my purchase.

I use these to call my kid when he is playing at the park or gym. I just put one on a key ring and told him to come find me when I make it beep. It works at least 100 ft in a large, dense jungle gym which is pretty impressive because it seems they should cause pretty bad interference with a signal like this. On top of that, he loves it! I no longer have to yell for him, and he is always excited when he hears the beep and runs back to the table as fast as he can.With how I've seen this work for my kid, I know they would work just fine for a remote or keys if they are just lost in your house.

Whoever designed this collection of useful tools deserves an award. It's compact, labeled well, and simple to use.

Well, these little brushes can be used for multiple things. I really like mine I can get into the corners of places. I haven’t been into for a long time. I’ll tell you that dirt really collects didn’t know it like these they’re great.

I was able to complete the tasks I wanted done but the handle was so flimsy that it bent when applying pressure.  However, the price was reasonable so I will consider them useful but quickly disposable.

I have used this for cleaning around all bathroom fixtures including the seat attachment points on the toilet. It is extremely durable and fits in the most difficult to reach areas with ease. I recommend this item for any cleaning needs that are in a tough to reach area or very narrow spots. the bristles hold up well and seem to revert to original even after vigorous scrubbing.

Found this very useful. It is quite handy for cleaning the ceiling fan vent in the bathroom that has little fins inside. Nothing else on hand was skinny or stiff enough for the job. I also used the brush in the typical bath and kitchen cleaning situations.

I have a glass shower, and there are some hard-to-get spots on the door, the brush is thin but strong enough to get the grime off, and it has worked perfectly in tight areas, that are difficult to clean.  Works as advertised, I gave a few to friends to try out as well.

I have been looking for tools that will help me clean small cracks in my window seals and in other kitchen items that have a very thin line that gathers dust. This product answered a desire I had for tools to take care of this problem. I use it on the rails of my sliding glass door and all my windows. The additional tools provided with this product are useful in cleaning too on window blinds and other things in the house.

I really like these brushes. While I won’t be using them on scratchable surfaces (they just seem too harsh) but they are perfect for cleaning out the vacuum filters and other small, thin unreachable areas around the house and out in the garage.

I love these KitchenAid shears! They're sharp, sturdy, and comfortable to hold – perfect for everything from snipping herbs to tackling chicken bones. But the best part? They come with a protective sheath.You see, my kids have a habit of ""borrowing"" my kitchen scissors for craft projects and who-knows-what-else, only to have them vanish into the abyss of their rooms. But thanks to this handy sheath, I can finally keep track of my shears! They're always where I left them, ready for kitchen duty.Plus, they're dishwasher safe, so even if the kids do manage to swipe them, at least I know they'll come back clean.If you're looking for a reliable, versatile pair of kitchen shears that can withstand both culinary tasks and the occasional kid-induced disappearance, look no further than KitchenAid.

KitchenAid usually doesn’t disappoint. These scissors are on the larger side, but the grip is very comfortable and easy to cut with. Cutting is smooth and sharp. I also like that it has multiple colors to choose from. I like the black since it doesn’t look out of place anywhere.

Very sharp and nice shears!! I have many many KitchenAid products in my home and it is a phenomenal brand that never disappoints! I was quick to buy these because I knew the quality would be amazing and at the low price, you can’t go wrong! They are extremely easy to clean and I use these for my hobby of 3D printing which is why I needed shears rather than regular scissors. The cutting is incredibly accurate every time even as a lefty! I love the fact that it has a sheath to avoid any accidents. I have two young kids and having everything sharp covered gives me peace of mind. I have had many shears in my time but I really like these because of the comfort grip and it came with a free sheath. Can’t go wrong with these, they are great! Highly recommend!!

I was standing right there when my son-in-law was trying to cut through something super tough with our kitchen scissors and the handle broke. My wife, who tends to get sentimental about odd things, complained that she had owned those for more than twenty years and had grown somewhat attached to them. I knew I would have to replace them with a nice pair it I was going to keep her happy, so I knew I was in good hands when I saw the ""Kitchen Aid"" label. Sure enough, they are razor sharp and look tough enough to last another twenty years.

Great price for a very helpful tool. Sometimes takes a couple of tries to get it to fully heat up and seal. It’s super fast and only takes seconds more than using a bag clip. Great quality, doesn’t get to hot, keeps everything fresh like new. Also works as a box opener with the blade that pops out. Has a magnet on the back to keep on the fridge but is very portable.
"

Amazing little gadget. One of the things I love about this product is its compact size. It is small and lightweight, making it easy to store and carry around. It is also very simple to use. All you have to do is press the sealing arm down on the bag and run it along the length of the bag. The heat from the sealing arm will melt the plastic, creating an airtight seal that will keep your food fresh for days.Another great feature of this product is its built-in cutter. It makes opening bags and sealing them back up a breeze. The magnet on the back of the sealer is also a nice touch. It allows you to keep the sealer close at hand on your fridge or other metal surfaces.I also appreciate that this product comes with two AA batteries included, so it is ready to use right out of the box. And since it uses batteries, you don't have to worry about finding an outlet or dealing with cords and wires.Overall, I highly recommend the mini bag sealer. It is a convenient and effective tool for keeping your snacks and other food items fresh. Its compact size, easy-to-use design, built-in cutter, and magnet make it a must-have for any home or office.

Plastic bags are made from many different polymers and it works pretty well on some, not so good on others. And it's very slow to properly seal a bag. A typical family size potato chip bag might take 2 x 15 second passes. AND STAY AWAY FROM THE EMBEDDED KNIFE. It's very, very sharp but awkward to use so keep it away from your fingers. USE IT AND YOU'LL CUT YOURSELF. I used it 3 times and cut myself twice.
"

This is a great, inexpensive way to keep things fresh. It works every time. If it starts to seal the bags poorly,  that's the time to change the batteries. Seals everything from chip bags to frozen fish in the bags. I highly recommend it.

This sealer was actually brought to my attention by an article I read on kitchen gadgets.  I checked it out on Amazon and after reading the product description I thought this cannot work as well as described in the article and on the Amazon Product Description but it was less than $10.00 so I thought I would give it a shot, knowing I could return it for a full refund.  As soon it arrived, I read the instructions and went to my pantry where I had several open chip bags.  I followed the instructions and it sealed the bags perfectly first time out.  I had a little problem knowing when to move it across the bag, but I learned it was pretty much instantaneously. As soon as you press it in on the device start sliding it across the bag. The actual sliding is a little more challenging but doable. The one thing I hope they improve is the shield between the two sealer edges that must be down for storage. Hopefully they can design it to be automatic instead of manual. This shield prevents the two hot (??) sealer edges from coming in contact (and heating up)  during storage.

This works as advertised. It does feel a little cheap in your hand, but I was actually surprised it performs as good as it does. Sure, it may not have all the cool features of one of the 'Best Buy' models, but this definitely does the job. The motor in it is pretty strong and it feels very nice on my back and arms where I mostly use it.The variety of attachments is pretty nice, but I only use maybe 2 of them. The pamphlet it comes with it informative on how to relieve pain in certain areas. I haven't quite utilized that yet as I just use it where it's hurting, but maybe I'll try it out.It charges quickly using USB-C and the battery lasts quite awhile with the use we've been giving it. I used it maybe twice a day for a few minutes each time for a week, and it only dropped to 60%. Seems like plenty for my usage at the moment.The case is nice. You can't fit it into the case with any of the attachments on. You'll have to take it off to store it. But it's not difficult to attach anything. It seems like the tip screws on/off to attach or maybe add pressure to keep the attachment on the massage gun, but it doesn't seem to loosen or tighten the attachment, so I'm not sure if that's the intended use or not. Taking it off doesn't change anything, so maybe I'm just misunderstanding what it's actual function is.Anyway, I'm happy with this budget friendly option for a massage gun. It really does feel very nice on my sore areas and muscles.

This thing is awesome! It literally does what it’s supposed to do. I can’t complain about it. I had a jar of peanut butter and I was able to scrape up every last dollop. Highly recommend!

I Love the Whimsy Plus the Good Functional Design

Well packaged for gifting, this spreader is the perfect gift for a cat lover.  The handle is firm while the “blade” has enough flexibility to remove a product from its jar.  Sadly it is a little too short to use on American jars for mayonnaise a such.While cute and useful, it’s sadly overpriced.

Had one for years and caught a sale to score another one I love them so much.  Plus how freakin cute are these?

I use this daily in many different sizes of jars. It works really well and helps get everything out of the jars. It’s both flexible and hard enough for even thicker things like peanut butter. As an added bonus it’s really cute and fun to use. I love it!

I just bought this because it was cute and loved it more in person! It's super cute and well made -looking forward to using it for years to come.

Bought a few of these for the cat lovers in my family. Perfect for getting the last bit of peanut butter out of the jar.

the salt shaker stopped working, we changed the batteries, still not working. I've tried to contact customer service, but no luck. I've been using this for maybe 2 months, maybe once or twice a day when I cook. Should not have stopped working. Sad part is there's no one to help you but a computer customer service.

### Review of Gravity Electric Salt and Pepper MillsI recently purchased the Gravity Electric Salt and Pepper Mills, and they have completely transformed my cooking and dining experience. From the sleek design to the effortless functionality, these mills are a must-have for any kitchen.**Design and Build Quality**The first thing that caught my eye was the modern and elegant design of these mills. They are crafted with high-quality stainless steel and clear acrylic, which not only looks great on the dining table but also ensures durability. The clear window allows you to easily see how much salt or pepper is left, which is a convenient feature.**Ease of Use**What sets these mills apart is the gravity operation. Simply tilt the mill, and it automatically starts grinding. There's no need to press any buttons or twist any knobs, making it incredibly easy to use, especially when you have your hands full while cooking. The adjustable coarseness setting is another fantastic feature, allowing you to choose between fine and coarse grinds to suit your taste.**Performance**The performance of these mills is outstanding. The ceramic grinding mechanism is efficient and provides a consistent grind every time. Whether you're seasoning a delicate dish or adding a robust flavor to a hearty meal, these mills deliver just the right amount of salt or pepper with precision.**Battery Life**The mills are powered by batteries, which last a long time even with frequent use. Changing the batteries is straightforward, and the mills come with a clear instruction manual that makes the setup process a breeze.**Overall Experience**Overall, I am extremely satisfied with my purchase of the Gravity Electric Salt and Pepper Mills. They combine style, functionality, and ease of use in a way that enhances both cooking and dining. I highly recommend these mills to anyone looking for a reliable and elegant solution for their seasoning needs. They make a great gift too!In conclusion, the Gravity Electric Salt and Pepper Mills are a fantastic addition to any kitchen. Their user-friendly design, consistent performance, and aesthetic appeal make them a standout product that I would gladly purchase again.

They both worked for awhile and loved them, but the salt grinder continues to clog and just will not work anymore. The salt grinds gets into the area where batteries are located and just corrodes the inside.

I bought these as a gift becasue I have bought a set before for myself and this time when the package arrived the product had clearly been used and one didnt work at all. Now with that being said, the set I bought before has been great and we use them daily. They look great, the function of being able to size you grind is awesome and many people who have used them at our home have indicated they wanted their own. Maybe the last order was a fluk but seeing how I bought them for a gift and they arrived used and not working is the reason for my 4 star review,

I saw these and debated it because I have a couple of nice spoon rests that I've used for years... but when I was making a large family meal and had multiple spoons and a fork on the stove, there just wasn't enough room and some of the utensils were hot and sauce dripped on the stove occasionally.  Well that day I went to my ""wish list"" and I bought one! I wondered why I waited so long! I use mine daily and it's better than any spoon holder I have EVER had or used.  The spoon holder is pretty but awkward and  sometimes gets in the way when I have a stove top full of cookware! These may not be decorated and pretty as one of my spoon holders but oh my gosh, I use them WAY more often and they clean up so much easier. I can sit it on the stove even when the oven is hot, no problem. I would never put it on or near a hot burner as I'm sure it could be damaged from direct heat...I can put several spoons and a fork on it and still have room.  I especially like that the utensils can be set in the grooves on an angle and any sauce that might drip off doesn't make a mess... just wash with dishes and back on the stove it goes.  I have used it for knives, serving forks, spoons, serving ladles.. and my spoon rest never did that!  It's flexible and durable, not flimsy at all.  They come in a LOT of different colors too!  The price is reasonable, it's well made and the seller shipped it to me very quickly or Amazon had them in stock at a local distribution center.. I got it in a day or so!  I have told family and friends about it. Even a friend who doesn't really cook,  asked ""What's this?"" and said oh she would actually use one.  This would also be a nice housewarming gift for a new cook or someone just getting started, maybe in a gift basket with some hand towels and hot pads!  I'm sure it would be appreciated too!

I recently added the Silicone Utensil Rest with Drip Pad to my kitchen arsenal, and I couldn't be happier with my purchase. It’s clean, sleek, and versatile.First and foremost, practicality is key, and this utensil rest delivers. Its silicone construction ensures durability and easy cleaning, making it a breeze to maintain even during the busiest of cooking sessions. The multiple slots allow me to neatly organize multiple utensils at once, keeping my countertop tidy and my utensils easily accessible. This handy accessory has quickly become an essential part of cooking routine.Affordability was also a major factor in my decision to purchase this utensil rest, and it certainly didn't disappoint in this regard. Despite its high-quality construction and functionality, it comes at a price that won't break the bank, making it accessible to all.What's more, the sleek design of this utensil rest seamlessly integrates into my kitchen color scheme and decor. Its neutral tones complement any style, adding a touch of minimalistic sophistication to my culinary space.Overall, I highly recommend this Silicone Drip Pad to anyone in need of a practical and affordable solution for a mess-free cooking experience. It's a game-changer that has earned its place as a staple in my kitchen.

This is my favorite utensil holder. Convenient and it stays in place wherever you put it. No more spoons slipping off the holder. It’s flat, supports all utensils and even tongs fit nicely. Great useful item that is easy to wash. Will gift one in the future.

It’s nice to have one place to hold multiple utensils. It’s big enough to hold my largest tools and has plenty of space to contain all the dripping messes. So much easier than cleaning the stove or counter a bunch of times.

I really like this. I normally have several pots and/or pans going on the stove at once, so I need more spaces for spoons. Those cute little ceramic one spoon holders look pretty but are not practical for me.  Plus,this is easy to clean and you can't accidently break it!

I am using these to organize diamond art painting pens on my work surface.  They are great except they slide down my drawing table even at a small tilt so I am using putty to hold them in place.  I was hoping the silicone factor would help prevent creeping but it doesn't.  I do like the units and may purchase more in the future.
