I had a set bought thru a local store, liked them enough to order this as a back up set.  The soles don't squeak when wet, good traction, comfortable for long days of walking.  Walked all over London and Dublin on a 10 day trip and was comfortable the whole time.  They seemed to dry quickly when they get wet.  Note  - they are not waterproof.  10/10, highly recommended.

In hindsight, I wish I would have ordered a half size larger. The fit is like a glove which some people might like.. I prefer a looser fit. Other then that, great shoe at a great price!

Perfect, mint condition, legit Nikes. These shoes are very sharp looking and they match more outfits than you might think. They go well with jeans and a white tee or khakis and white tee. They coordinate with coral shorts and a yellow shirt or my baby blue Adidas outfit. I wore all black with these shoes and I got compliments all day. Yep, nice kicks.

I had an issue looking at 15 pairs over 3 stores in the mall, every pair had access GLUE on the bottom and defects/ leather blemishes, which you get from mas producing shoes. I found this pair was free of that and im happy with my purchase.I typically wear a 10.5 but the 11 in this variation on Nike fit my feet better.Classic panda colors, wanted to match the  wifey.

I wanted some new teniss shoes that looked stylish for every day wear at the office or out on the weekends with friends. And these definitely hit the mark! Very stylish and good looking, well crafted shoes. I was surprised with how comfortable they immediately were as well, which isn't always the case with tennis shoes before they are broken in. They hit all the right ticks!

everyone knows kids are hard on shoes if they don't outgrow them first.. my grandson has worn these 2 years now every day and they are the best for wear.. I m amazed that these have held up because he certainly has gone through several other pairs including the bottom falling off the shoe!  the toe box lifting up like a clowns shoe!  These Nike's have been the best of all his shoes and still lasting!!!  Definitely would order more of this shoe!

My Nike Air Force One fits me perfectly in size 11 1/2. The one foot is a bit larger than the other. When I bought these in 11 1/2, they were extremely tight. I moved onto 12, and still, my toe touched the tip. I finally ordered 12 1/2 just to give it a shot, and voilà they fit perfectly.Not sure what's up with Nike when sizing these shoes/sneakers, but someone takes a look at what's going on in the factory where these are made. When you get past the sizing, the shoe fits great, it has a nice bounce in the ball of the foot and is very comfortable. Good luck finding the right size. Do yourself a favor and order at least 1/2 size larger. I know it sounds odd to say order a size larger that might be what it takes. It was for me. I do highly recommend these though when you find the right fit.

I’ve used versions of this shoe since 1982, while still a young buck.  These are the most comfortable, yet.  My 4-stars is because I don’t believe the lace loops will hold up with tight tension, as previous ones have broke. But, Amazon also sells brass eyelet kits that if you think there’s enough value left in the shoe, you can repair it.  I also add Spenco inserts, removing the OEM ones.  Also, my first recent shoes a couple weeks ago came only in a bag! This is my backup pair.  I always repurpose the nice boxes, like shown. For the thousands of you with an 8"" pet Amazon…..the jungle River, tarantula , these make good carriers when showing off your pet in public.

Shoes arrived a day early, and in perfect condition. The top of the original box was missing, but that box was packaged inside a bigger, sturdier cardboard box for shipping, and it did its job in keeping the shoes from being compromised in any way. I noticed a whole horde of comments are condemning the seller for sending a slightly damaged original box and I find this SO ridiculous. Those orange Nike logo boxes are flimsy from the start, and aren’t made for shipping - only for in-store handling.  This is a great product from a reputable seller - give these a try!

I have several pairs of Nikes and these are by far the worst constructed ones I have purchased. The fake leather will peel off and makes them look like crap. I wouldn’t recommend buying this design. Spend a little more and get a quality shoe.

Shoe came with tons of paint specs on the rubber bottom.  There's black, red, blue specs covering the rubber bottom of the shoe.  ""Leather"" portion of the the shoe looks amazing, except for some stitching that is frayed (easily fixed with careful use of a bic lighter).  This leads me to believe the seller I chose is sending out rejected factory shoes they got their hands on that did not meet standards or perhaps shoes that were returned that had been previously worn by a pastel art painter (lol).  Not sure if I will return and repurchase do to time and hassle, going to try and figure out how to remove paint from rubber effectively (because other than that and the frayed stitching which can be easily fixed) these shoes are actually very hard to come by in specific sizings unless you want to buy from Ebay or small online retailers in Europe.Edit:  They were actually a different model of Nike that I received.  They were DH3160s and not CQ9246s.SELLER:  JMEGoods

All the running snobs hate on Nike running shoes, but I have run thousands of miles in Nike Pegs and they have always been my favorite shoe. I have run in asics, brooks, new balance, saucony, and I keep coming back to this shoe.It's got a soft heel that is good for heel strikers like me (meaning when your front foot hits the ground it actually hits on the heel, not the middle of the foot. If you're a mid foot striker this isnt' the shoe for you.

I am in my early 60's and run 3 miles every other day of the week.  At 220 lbs it has become more of a challenge to get through a run comfortably the last few years.  The cushion in these shoes is great.  I also developed bunions in the back of my heel in the military wearing garrison shoes and other running shoes would only last 100 miles or so before the padding in the back of the shoe had a hole worn into them and started giving me blisters.  Nike shoes have a design that has never worn out for me and I transition them to my every day walking shoes when I get a new pair of runners.  I have been wearing Nike Running shoes for that reason since 2005.  Color doesn't matter, I usually buy this model at the lowest price I can find but it seems they come in every color of the rainbow which would appeal to most folks.

To me, this is the one of the nicest looking running shoes out there right now. White is a great shoe color and most running shoes look ugly in my opinion.I was concerned coming into this with how dirty it would look due to dirt, but it's actually very manageable. Simply throw it in the washing machine with some Oxyclean, air dry, and it looks nearly brand new. If excessively soiled, soak in Oxyclean overnight and then wash.The fit is true to size but slightly snug as you break it in. The entire front of the shoe is like a soft mesh so it's very comfortable, but that also means if you kick anything it'll hurt, trust me. The cushion is pretty good- an upgrade over non running shoes but not excessive like Hoka's. I can walk for about one and a half hours before my feet actually start hurting.Overall, would recommend. Definitely is kinda pricey but it's hard to find good looking running shoes so it's an L I was willing to take.

Was looking for the previous model of Pegasus Air Zoom because it's one of very few running shoes that fit with insoles but I couldn't find it anymore. However this Pegasus model fits also fantastic. It may sound bit strange, but finding sport shoes with the possibility to fit insoles is a real challenge. Not anymore.

I suffer from lumbar hernia and a bad knee due to an accident and these shoes are great for when I have to be standing up or walking for a long time.  They fit just right, they are very lightweight, don't get my feet hot (I feel like they have breathable fabric) and for sure are comfortable.

I don't know how these shoes aren't rated a lot lower they are very cheaply made the material is very thin and feels like it can easily detach from the white part. The insole of the shoe is just like plastic and just feels uncomfortable. The sole itself is very hard and just feels like cheap plastic. Walking around in them feels horrible because it just feels like walking on hard plastic.  They were also very narrow at least for me. I know some people will say what do you expect for $60 but these shoes should honestly be $30 or less than that.

The Nike Air Max 2017 Men's Running Shoes are a great option for people looking for comfortable and stylish shoes. The shoes feature a sleek and modern design, with a breathable mesh upper that allows for maximum airflow and keeps feet cool and dry. While it's coined a ""running shoe"", I don't think this would be a great shoe for serious runners. To me, it's better labeled a ""casual shoe"". Two reasons for this:· It's actually a pretty heavy shoe.· The rebound isn't all that responsive.For a casual shoe, one of the standout features of these shoes is the Air Max cushioning system, which provides shock absorption and support. We've owned previous versions of this same shoe without the shock absorption- there's a big difference. The cushioning is good for long walks, providing the necessary support and comfort.The outsole of the Air Max 2017 is made of durable rubber for traction and durability. The outsole also features a waffle pattern that helps to grip the ground, making it comfortable to walk on a variety of surfaces. The outsole also features a flex groove design which allows for a natural range of motion and a more efficient stride.The fit of the shoe is true to size. The shoes also have a padded collar and tongue for added comfort and support. My son has worn the shoes for three days. While he is happy with the overall fit, the toe box may be a little shallow which has caused him to trip a few times. I am sure this will improve with time.Overall, these Nike shoes are a good option for a casual shoe that provides a comfortable, supportive, and stylish shoe. I only rated the shoes as four stars because Nike continues to call this a running shoe when it's actually a casual shoe. Hopefully, Nike will eventually separate casual athletic shoes from true running shoes.

After 6 months the right shoe started to feel odd, as if something shifted in the heal area and it no longer allows my foot to land flat. My foot falls to the inside and makes it very uncomfortable to wear. $175 wasted. I can help but wonder if it was a defective batch of shoes sold by a third party. Buyer beware!!

I got these as a gift for my husband and was super happy with how they looked. He also loved them until we noticed there were two left shoes. Did not see an option to exchange the shoes so I had to chat with Amazon support. They told me they would get a replacement ordered, but just about a week later I got an email that they couldn't reach the seller and I would just have to return them. I ended up having to pay to ship them back so just a waste of time and money. Super disappointed they wouldn't just send a replacement.

Was a little nervous at first ordering shoes online regarding size and fit, but after receiving and re-lacing these , they fit perfectly. I've always wanted this color combo, so pretty psyched. Glad I went with my gut and ordered my size.  Much gratitude to the seller and sending these so quickly.

These are noticeably more stable than my normal running shoes during weight lifting. They are especially nice for squats, lunges, deadlifts, or standing and pressing weight overhead.

Comfortable and good looking. I had to speed walk about 5 1/2 miles only a couple days after getting the shoes. My feet felt fine afterwards and I had stability during my walk.

The first day I wore these, I went for a walk, and upon my walk was a nice big pile of dog doo doo. I was unaware of this big pile of doo-doo until it was too late. As I flew ybackward, I recall looking up at the sky, and to my surprise, I saw one of my brand new shoes flying by.  Next thing I knew I was lying there on the cold, hard sidewalk in such shock I layed there for what felt like forever. I slowly began to rise to my feet. I started to check myself for any injuries when suddenly I got a whiff of a nostril-burning foul smell. I reached my hand around to my back only to bring it right back abruptly.  I let out a loud scream followed by a gagging reaction to the dog poop that was now on my hand.  I ran to the grass and dropped to my knees I frantically began wiping my hand on the grass. As a tear ran down my face I remembered thinking can this day get any worse? Well, guess what it did! Behind me was a loud bark that scared me so much I jumped forward. I was now lying on the ground once more. As I got to my knees, I stood up quickly, eager to see the culprit that I believed to be the doggy doo doo bandit, but as I turned around to confront this demon, I promptly began to plead because in this dogs mouth was my other shoe I slowly began to approach this dog as I got close enough I made a daring move I tried to jump on the dog. I was unsuccessful with dog poop on my back, and with only one shoe on, I began to walk home sad and smelly.  Anyway I hope this helps your decision to buy these shoes or not

I bought a pair of these shoes because I needed a comfortable pair of black shoes for work. They were great for a few days and then started to squeak with every step. I figured it would go away after they get broken in, but it got worse. When I was in FL i stepped off my boat and sank knee deep in mud and lost my shoes, so I ordered another pair, because they are comfortable and affordable. They feel good while working in the office, and they feel good for walking or running on the track. But wouldn't you know it? The second pair also squeaks. If you intend to use these for walking on grass or dirt, I definitely recommend these shoes, but be ware of the dreaded squeak....

I am a woman who owns Nike Tanjun sneakers in various colors, so I ordered these for my son.  He agrees that these are the best feeling sneakers he has ever worn!  He has been wearing them for months, and they still look & feel like new.  They are totally fashionable, but most of all, they offer extreme comfort that you just can't find in other sneakers.  The fit is true to size,  but most MEN can go up 1/2 size for the best comfort you've ever felt.  The Fashion & Comfort factors are 100 stars!!!  (And btw, my 90 year old dad also LOVES wearing Nike Tanjuns, and his 73 yr old wife too!  Proof that these are not just for 18 yr olds! :)  Best to wait & get them when the price is equal or lower than shopping at DSW or other online shoe stores.  Enjoy!

I love the minimalist design of the shoe, they are lightweight, perfect for walking, workout or just waking around the house. I don't give five stars because the left shoe was a little tight on the front but, over time it has expanded.

I just finished darning a hole that developed in the fabric of these shoes.  Really surprised and disappointed that I had to do that, especially since these shoes are less than a year old.  If this had been a cheap generic shoe from Walmart I would have expected as much but I paid up for a pair of Nikes with great reviews assuming they would outlast my previous pair of running shoes.  By the way that pair of previous shoes were a cheap generic pair from Target that lasted a few years. Comfort level was okay but not as amazing as I would have liked.  I spend most of my days standing / walking, so I was hoping for something that would leave my feet feeling good at the end of the day.  As it stands my feet usually hurt by days end, though admittedly feel better than when I wore the cheap Target shoes. Visually these look good and are well ventilated as you would expect.  They dry nicely when they happen to get wet.Overall I am ranking them at a 2 out of 5 simple because I paid over 70 dollars and had to patch a hole in the toe box and it’s not even been a year, for only a moderately more comfortable shoe.  Hopefully this is the only hole that I’ll be seeing and can get a bit more life out of these things before I have to invest in another daily walker.Update: 11/15/2021.  Changed my review of these shoes to 1 star.  It's been several months since my last review.  The toe box of this shoe is wearing out in multiple places.  Has been for awhile but I've put off looking for a new pair just because I expected more out of a pair of Nikes and wanted to get at least 1 year out of these.  They did manage to not completely fall apart before 1 year was over.  Take my review for what it's worth since it's in the minority but I guess the construction on these are hit and miss, as some people seem to report the issue I have while many others rave about them.  Good luck if you get them.

My wife has been begging (bugging) me for Nike “dunks” but I couldn’t afford to pay over $120-$150 so I was over the moon when I found these very dunk-like Nikes for her and she was equally pleased. Nike may run larger; I had to return them at first for a smaller size so you might want to order them 1/2 size smaller than you normally would. They’re still very trendy and comfortable. The pink color is feminine and playful yet they aren’t garish and can be paired with earth tones or loud colors. I highly recommend!

Haven’t worn em yet, probably won’t for a while til a special ocassion or a date…maybe my vacation in August…BUT these are PURE FIRE and for tha price, I could NOT pass.  Need to cop me some display cases for my next few finds like this. Don’t regret it! If these is ur color, snag em before it’s too late. They also fit much better than other shoes in my size: not tight at all, but firm like a glove for once.

I’ve worn an 11 for years in Nike products, but I could’ve used an 11 1/2 in this shoe as it is a bit more snug fit. I needed a larger arch support than I’ve been able to find in stores and this one is OK. This is a discontinued line.  The stability is good and it grips the floor well. The darker color blends in well with different styles of clothes so I can wear these to work. Overall, I’m happy with this purchase.

I learned to love a lot my first pair of Nike Run Swift 2. When i needed to replace the worn out one, i found it available in amazon with more exciting colors and design. I will love this new pair even better!
